In order to allow the conveyance of information between components within myGrid, and the workflow enactor particularly, we have defined an XML wrapper format which combines data and low level semantic metadata in one document. We define a mapping between standard java collection types and this document structure, and this mandates the creation of new semantically enabled collection objects to avoid the loss of the metadata during round trip conversions to and from the document format. This package therefore contains implementations of the standard collection interfaces which allow preservation of this information. Additional methods are added to the base interfaces to allow storage and retrieval of the semantic metadata associated with each item in the collection.
