<p>API Inspector</p>
<p>The API Inspector is a tool to allow Taverna to make use of the information in Java source files that is subsequently lost during compilation such as parameter names within methods, javadoc comments and the like. It allows the user to select classes from a set of source files which are then exposed in the workbench application.</p>
<p>This package contains the classes required to build the user interface and query the javadoc object model to extract information about the selected classes. It uses the JDOM toolkit to construct an XML document which can be used by Taverna during workflow design and invocation. </p>
