Top level package for the application specific portions of Taverna, this excludes language generic classes related to the processing of Scufl and manipulation of ScuflModels. At the moment, the retsina subpackage doesn't make use of any of the scuf language classes, it was written as an initial first test to get something working. In all probability this entire package will eventually go away to be replaced with something that has actually been designed properly
