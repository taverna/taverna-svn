This Folder is the root for the Taverna Output files.
Each Taverna Run (Not WireIt run) will create its own directory.
Directory names are time based YEAY_MONTH_DAY_HOUR_MINUTE_SECOND so they sort by time.

Each directory contains three files

BaclavaOutput.xml is the actual output file as generated by Taverna Command Line

Output.txt is the output that Command Line sent to the console plus a bit of extra information added by the wrapper.

TavernaLog.txt is the taverna log file. (assuming logging set up correctly)
