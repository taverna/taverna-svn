There are two parameters that need to be configured inside WEB-INF/web.xml before the portlets can function properly
(you will have to stop and restart your container for the changes to take effect).

The first parameter is T2_SERVER_URL, which points to the base URL of the Taverna Server to be used to submit the workflows to.

Your WEB-INF/web.xml should contain something like:

    <context-param>
        <param-name>T2_SERVER_URL</param-name>
        <param-value>http://<SERVER:PORT>/taverna-server</param-value>
        <description>The URL of the T2 Server to be used for executing the workflows</description>
    </context-param>


The second parameter is JOBS_DIRECTORY_PATH, which is a directory on your local file system where the portlets will
write, for example workflow results and other things about workflow runs. Make sure the portall app has write access to this directory.

Your WEB-INF/web.xml should contain something like:

    <context-param>
        <param-name>JOBS_DIRECTORY_PATH</param-name>
        <param-value>/tmp/portal-results</param-value>
        <description>Absolute path to a directory on the local file system where the app can write info about submitted jobs to</description>
    </context-param>
