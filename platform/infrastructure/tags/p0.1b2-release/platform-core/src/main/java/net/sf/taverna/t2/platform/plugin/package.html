Plug-in management facilities, including scanning active plug-in
packages for implementations of Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs). For
most use within external code we expect an instance of PluginManager to
be the primary entry point. Plug-ins are identifier by instances of
PluginIdentifier which are similar to maven artifact specifiers in that
they consist of groupId/pluginId/version tuples, these are represented
in string form by the string 'plugin:
<em>groupId</em>
:
<em>pluginId</em>
:
<em>version</em>
'
