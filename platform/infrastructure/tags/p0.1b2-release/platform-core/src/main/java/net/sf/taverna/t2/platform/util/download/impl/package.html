Implementations of the net.sf.taverna.t2.platform.util.download
interfaces. While these implementation classes are available to your
code they should not be used directly, use the platform level
initialization and code against the interfaces if you have a need for
this low level functionality directly from your own code. There is no
stability guarantee for classes in this package!
