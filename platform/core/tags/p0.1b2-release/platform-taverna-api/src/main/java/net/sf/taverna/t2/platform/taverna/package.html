Context profile and interfaces to beans defined by the profile. The T2
platform uses profiles as a way to ensure a set of named and typed
service beans are present in a given application context and to provide
type-safe access to those beans. Applications can then depend upon the
service interfaces from this profile without having to worry about
whether the spring configuration contains beans of the appropriate types
as the profile performs this check on construction.
