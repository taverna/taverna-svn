Archetypes are not built along with the rest of the core - this 
is because as far as I can see there's a set of bugs when running
maven from eclipse which prevent the build functioning correctly. 
They do, however, inherit from the parent pom.

To build these you'll need to manually launch the pom.xml with an 
appropriate goal (install or deploy normally)
