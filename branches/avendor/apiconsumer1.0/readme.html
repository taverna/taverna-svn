<p><strong>API Consumer 1.0</strong>, <a href="mailto:tmo@ebi.ac.uk">tmo@ebi.ac.uk</a>, 
  25th Feb 2005</p>
<p>This tool is used to consume an API (existing Java library with source code) 
  and produce a description of a subset of the methods within that API such that 
  Taverna can then use these as modules within a workflow. Run the tool by putting 
  your source files in the 'target' directory and running 'ant'. The build will 
  fail if there are no classes to process as is normal with javadoc based tools.</p>
<p>You may need to move the tools.jar into your<em> /jre/lib/ext</em> directory 
  for this process to work as the javadoc classes are not included by default 
  in the system classpath. </p>
<p>This tool is for use with <a href="http://taverna.sf.net">Taverna</a> version 
  1.1 or higher (so versions from CVS at the moment, seeing as 1.1 hasn't actually 
  been released yet).</p>
