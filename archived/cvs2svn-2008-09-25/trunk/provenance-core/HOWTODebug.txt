MAVEN_OPTS="-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,suspend=n,server=y,address=8000" mvn tomcat:run


then attach a debugger to port 8000 from eclipse:

from Stian:

Start Tomcat with
-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,suspend=n,server=y,address=8000 and you
can attach to it from the debug mode in Eclipse on port 8000.

In Chicago we even managed to do this with the Globus container, which
was a great help!

(You can set it to suspend=y if you want the container to pause until
Eclipse is attached).

The only thing left then is to add various source folders in the debug
mode. (You should be able to get the source of the JAR by
right-clicking on the project and say Maven->Get source code or
something)
