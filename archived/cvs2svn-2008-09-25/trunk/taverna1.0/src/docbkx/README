for HTML generation I've used xsltproc with the following command:

xsltproc --xinclude -o $OUTDIR xsl/html-taverna.xsl book_taverna_manual.xml 

which uses the custom stylesheet xsl/html-taverna.xsl - this extends the sourceforge docbook-xsl .  The OUTDIR must end in a / or
the output goes to the directory containing OUTDIR (on the Mac anyway).  Note that xsltproc is a memory hog and does not fail gracefully when
out of memory, generating erroneous errors instead.  If you get a non-obvious error then try getting it more memory e.g. by closing
other programs.

Depending upon your installation of docbook-xsl you are likely to modify the import path for the base chunk.xsl near the top on html-taverna.xsl

Once the html has been generated, images and html.css need copying over to $OUTDIR manually.

For the PDF generation I used DocMan (0.99d) from within Linux (also works in Windows but there is no Mac version).
