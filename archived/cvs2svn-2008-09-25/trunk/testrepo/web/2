{[http://www.mygrid.org.uk/testrepo//workflow/16], [http://www.mygrid.org.uk/testrepo/o/description], "Starts by fetching all gene IDs from Ensembl corresponding to human genes on chromosome 22 implicated in known diseases and with homologous genes in rat and mouse. For each of these gene IDs it fetches the 200bp after the five prime end of the genomic sequence in each organism and performs a multiple alignment of the sequences using the EMBOSS tool 'emma' (a wrapper around ClustalW). Returns PNG images of the multiple alignment along with three columns containing the human, rat and mouse gene IDs used in each case.

As an enhancement to show the Jmol rendering in action this also fetches the PDB identifiers (where present) and the corresponding coordinate flat files from the RCSB, presenting the structures to the user in an interactive form via the Jmol plugin."}

The raw 'dot' text from the visualisation service is then passed into a Soaplab wrapper around the 'dot' tool from AT&T research which performs graph layout and renders to a PNG image. While this is happening the FASTA format sequence is fetched from the SeqHound server, wrapped into 80 column format with seqret (from the EMBOSS tool set) and BLASTed against the known Arabidopsis coding regions using a BioMoby service (this is pretty pointless, the gene is from human so unlikely to produce anything interesting, it's just there to demonstrate that we can interoperate these services)"}
