<h1>Enable Touch Type Ontology</h1>

<p>
causes a dialog with vocabulary terms to appear whenever the current
data field supports an ontology service.  This dialog shows a list of
ontology terms that changes whenever you type keystrokes in the form
field.  When you tab to the next field that supports an ontology
service, the dialog completely changes its list of terms to reflect
the new service.

<p>
A field may have multiple ontology services associated with it.  In
this case, the touch type ontology dialog uses the highest priority
service which is active.  

<p>
To change the priority of ontology services:
<ul>
<li>right-click on any field supported by an ontology</li>
<li>Click on the "Service Configuration" button.</li>
<li>Click and hold the row containing the service you want to make the
highest
priority.
</li>
<li>drag the mouse cursor over the top row of the table and release
the mouse.You should see that the rows have been reoordered, with your
new choice having the highest priority.</li>
<li>make sure your service is enabled</li>
</ul>
<li>
