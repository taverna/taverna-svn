<h1>Favourite File</h1>

<p>
Opens a favourite file. Each time you start the application, it will
present a list of most recently used files under the "Favourites" sub
menu of the "File" menu. 

<p>
You will not see this File menu feature when you use the program for
the first time.  You must open existing files or save new ones for
them to be registered as a favourite file the next time you start the application.
