Provides the implementation classes for the workflow advice SPI. This plugin mechanism 
allows the provision of atomic advisory plugins to operate over a workflow instance 
and supply feedback about any potential errors in the workflow. Such errors may 
include unbound WSDL input ports, unused workflow inputs or outputs, implied coordination 
constraints or duplicate links or other information.
