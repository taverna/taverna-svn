<h2><a name="1"></a>Support for stateful services</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Taverna provides support 
    for stateful web services or, in the future, grid services (same difference 
    really) by two language features. Specifically, the coordination constraint 
    mechanism and implicit iteration support.</p>
  <p>Stateful services are 
    characterized by the additional requirement to comprehend and represent the 
    pattern of interactions that will allow the service to perform its function. 
    For example, a typical design pattern is the factory model. In this model 
    the first call is to create some server side session, subsequent calls manipulate 
    this session (in which the statefulness of the service is encapsulated) and 
    a final call releases the session, allowing the server to release any resources 
    that the session may have been holding.</p>
  <p>In this case, we cannot rely purely on the data link driven invocation of 
    services. It makes sense that we should only call the release operation once 
    we have finished with the service instance, but it is unlikely that, say, 
    the final invocation of a 'get results' operation will pass data to the release 
    operation. In order to express these kinds of constraints the SCUFL language 
    has the notion of coordination constraint definitions. These take the form 
    of statements such as 'processor A may not transition from state SCHEDULED 
    to state RUNNING until processor B has attained state COMPLETED'. By this 
    mechanism, it is possible to coordinate the various operations that make up 
    the functionality of a stateful service.</p>
  <table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="2">
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><p>The example to the right shows a typical use of the 
          factory pattern. The CreateSession processor is called immediately, 
          this creates a session on the server and passes a reference to this 
          session to the other processors in the workflow. The two AddTerm processors 
          accept overall workflow inputs and add data to the session; these do 
          not require constraints as they can only run after the session id is 
          present (so there is a direct data link). The GetResults processor passes 
          some view on the session state to the workflow output - this should 
          only run when the two AddTerm processors have completed, so there are 
          two data constraints present to ensure this. In turn, the ReleaseSession 
          processor should only run once the results have been fetched, so, again, 
          there is a coordination link back to the GetResults processor.</p>
        <p>The available states for transition control are SCHEDULED, RUNNING, 
          COMPLETED, FAILED and ABORTED, although at present the enactor implementation 
          only allows you to do the type of coordination constraint shown to the 
          right, that of 'block from SCHEDULED to RUNNING until something else 
          has COMPLETED'. In the future we will implement this in a more general 
          way, in particular to allow automatic failover between equivalent processors.</p></td>
      <td><img src="factory_pattern.png" alt="Factory pattern example" width="454" height="510"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Although not an essential 
    feature, the implicit iteration support makes it very simple to use factory 
    based services. One example of such a service is the Gene Ontology Visualization 
    service at the European Bioinformatics Institute<a href="#r"><sup>[1]</sup></a> 
    (EBI). Simply, the interface allows you to create a session, add a Gene Ontology<sup><a href="#r">[2]</a> 
    </sup>(GO) term to the session and to get the current heirarchy containing 
    all the terms that have been added up to that time. An additional method informs 
    the server that it may release the resources used, in this case connections 
    to an Oracle instance. In order to be able to add multiple data items, say 
    from a stateless service that has returned an array of GO terms, the implicit 
    iteration support can be used to allow the array to be passed directly to 
    the operation taking a single term; the Taverna enactor extensions will interpret 
    this as meaning that it should repeatedly invoke the 'add term' method on 
    each of items in the array, expanding the array into a series of calls with 
    items of the same type but lower dimensionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="2"></a>High level 
  conceptual model</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The intention with the 
    SCUFL language was to simplify the process of creating workflows for eScience 
    by making the language granularity and concepts as close as feasibly possible 
    to those that a potential user of the system would already be thinking in. 
    So, if the scientist would see something as a single operation, we have tried 
    to make this appear in the language as a single processing entity. In instances 
    where this is not possible to do generally we have chosen to make service 
    specific processor types, sacrificing theoretical purity for greater ease 
    of use and practicality - this is most obvious in the Soaplab<sup><a href="#r">[3]</a></sup> 
    processor task; you could call Soaplab as a series of WSDL<sup><a href="#r">[4]</a></sup> 
    based tasks, but it would be extremely awkward by comparison, and counterintuitive 
    to someone who thinks of, say, the EMBOSS<sup><a href="#r">[5]</a></sup> toolset 
    as containing atomic tools rather than APIs they would expect to have some 
    detailed interaction with.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="3"></a>Implicit 
  iteration support</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>As previously mentioned under support for stateful services, the Taverna 
    extensions to the Workflow Enactment Engine (enactor) allow a certain limited 
    range of automatic transformations on data in between services where the service 
    output and the service input types do not match. Specifically, if the data 
    input expects type '<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">a</font>' and 
    the output of the previous processor is providing type '<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">a[]</font>', 
    an array of items of type '<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">a</font>', Taverna 
    will automatically iterate over the input array, invoking the service with 
    each possible combination of inputs and packaging the outputs into a new array, 
    effectively converting a service that has type '<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">a-&gt;b</font>' 
    to one with type '<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">a[]-&gt;b[]</font>'. This 
    is the simple case.</p>
  <p>Where there is more than 
    one input the current algorithm is to compute the orthogonal join of all the 
    input data to derive the list of sets of inputs to the service and then iterate 
    over this list, packaging any results into arrays at the other end. In the 
    example of the stateful GO service, one input to the 'add term' method was 
    the session identifier, the other being the term accession number to add; 
    the Taverna iteration support created a trivial join between these data sets 
    to produce a list of inputs, all of which had the same single session identifier 
    and with one row per element in the term accession array. Had there been an 
    array of session identifiers as well then the service would have been invoked 
    using all possible combinations of inputs, and would have had the effect of 
    adding all terms to all sessions specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="4"></a>Nested 
  or recursive workflows</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is possible to incorporate 
    a workflow inside another workflow. This is implmented in Taverna by creating 
    a new processor type where the inputs and outputs of the processor are derived 
    from the overall workflow sources and sinks of the workflow contained within. 
    The current implementation runs a new enactor invocation for the nested workflow, 
    although this is an implementation detail and might well change in the future. 
    This allows the creation of complex building blocks which may then be used 
    analogously to function or object libraries in classical programming languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="5"></a>Open source 
  reference implementation</h2>
<blockquote><p>As part of the 
  <sup>my</sup>Grid<sup><a href="#r">[6]</a></sup> project, Taverna is developed 
  in the spirit and released under the terms of the LGPL<sup><a href="#r">[7]</a></sup>. 
  Our development process is entirely open and visible from the SourceForge<sup><a href="#r">[8]</a></sup> 
  project module 'taverna', and all software thus produced is freely available. 
  Our reference implementation is well documented and written in Java<sup><a href="#r">[9]</a></sup> 
  both to make our lives easier and to allow a level of platform independance 
  - elements of Taverna use features that are present only in Java 1.4.1 but with 
  that caveat aside it should operate on any platform with a suitable Java Virtual 
  Machine (JVM).</p> 
  <p>The reference implementation 
    includes the core object model to represent a SCUFL workflow and its component 
    entities, a set of parsers to load this model from the XML<sup><a href="#r">[10]</a></sup> 
    form of the language, various basic view classes such as a view that exports 
    the XML form and one that shows the workflow as a Dot<sup><a href="#r">[11]</a></sup> 
    file. In addition, a collection of swing user interface components is provided 
    to allow rapid development of applications using the code object model, and 
    a sample editor application, the Scufl Workbench is included, both as a demonstrator 
    of the software components and as a real world tool for creating, editing 
    and enacting workflows. In order to enable invocation of SCUFL workflows there 
    is a set of extensions to the enactor to allow it to handle SCUFL without 
    further modification. The user guide has more information on how to install 
    and configure the enactor with Taverna support enabled, and the Scufl Workbench 
    includes a preconfigured version of the enactor to allow direct invocation 
    of workflows during their development.</p>
