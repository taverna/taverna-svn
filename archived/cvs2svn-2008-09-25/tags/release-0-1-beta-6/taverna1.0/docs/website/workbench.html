<h2><a name="1"></a>About the Scufl Workbench</h2><blockquote><p>This point release of the Taverna 
  project contains an application called the Scufl Workbench. This is intended 
  to allow you to create, edit and otherwise tinker with workflows based on the 
  Scufl language. It is not in its final form, but there is sufficient editing 
  functionality to produce new workflows that are at least vaguely functional. 
  An instance of the workbench contains exactly one Scufl model, and provides 
  zero or more arbitrary view and controller components over that model. It looks 
  something like this : <br>

<h2><a name="2"></a>Launching the workbench </h2>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>win32  : double click on the runme.bat
others : you'll need to launch it manually, examine the batch file (and contribute
         the script back!)</pre>
  <p>The binary 
    release incorporates a copy of the win32 version of the dot tool and its associated 
    libraries. If you have java in your path and are on a moderately recent version 
    of windows you should be able to simply double click on the batch file. Note 
    that if you are behind a firewall and require a web proxy, such as in Nottingham, 
    you will need to add the -Dhttp.proxyPort and http.proxyHost properties to 
    the java invocation in the batch file. If the application seems to hang whenever 
    you load a processor or a workflow this is the most likely cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="3"></a>Available components within the workbench</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p >The workbench 
    is intended to act as a container to assorted user interface components. These 
    components act as either views, controllers or both on the underlying ScuflModel 
    instance. For example, the graphical view is only a view, the service panel 
    only a controller and the explorer an example of both roles. View components 
    respond to model events, so they will always display the current state of 
    the model, there is no need to explicitly refresh them. The available components 
    in this release are as follows.</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Scufl model explorer<br>
        This shows the state of the current model as a tree. At the top level 
        are the different types of entities within a scufl model - overall workflow 
        inputs and outputs, processors, data links and coordination controls. 
        Processor nodes may be expanded to reveal their inputs and outputs. Most 
        nodes have context menus associated with them, see the 'how do I...' section 
        for more information, or just have a play around.</li>
      <li>XScufl view<br>
        This shows the current model as XScufl. This is what will be saved if 
        you select 'Save as XScufl' from the file menu. It is not editable, and 
        merely presents a view on the model.</li>
      <li>Dot view<br>
        Similarly to the XScufl view, this shows the dot text for the current 
        model. This was really only so I could figure out what was going wrong 
        with the graphical display, but you might find it interesting.</li>
      <li>Graphical view<br>
        This shows a graphical view of the workflow. This view requires you to 
        have the dot tool and its associated libraries installed on your machine, 
        and present on the path, otherwise the application won't be able to find 
        it. This component sends the dot view to dot, reading the result back 
        into a buffered image and updating the display.</li>
      <li>Available service 
        panel<br>
        This panel shows potential processors that can be added to the workflow 
        model. It is entirely a controller, there is no workflow state reflected 
        in it. Initially it is configured to show the services available through 
        soaplab at the EBI, and also show the xembl service as an example of a 
        WSDL processor creator (I'm not sure whether the xembl service is actually 
        maintained). Context menus on this component allow you to add new processors 
        to the workflow, and also to add new scavengers - components that fetch 
        sets of service factories - to the service panel</li>
      <li>Enactor launch panel.<br>
        Allows you to specify inputs to the workflow and launch a local instance 
        of the enactor. This is actually sufficiently functional for real use, 
        but in particular for myGrid developers it provides a way to test that 
        your workflows can actually run.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <p >These 
    components may be displayed, or additional instances created, by selecting 
    the appropriate option from the 'view' menu in the main window. The 'file' 
    menu provides import, export and model reset operations.</p>

<h2><a name="4"></a>How do I ...? </h2>
<blockquote> 
  <ul>
    <li><a name="4a"></a> <strong><font color="#0000CC">...add my services to 
      the service panel?</font></strong><br>
      You need to create a new scavenger. Right click on the 'Available Processors' 
      node at the top of the service panel. This should give you a menu from which 
      you can choose which type of scavenger you want. 
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>WSDL services</strong> - this is the most common type of 
          scavenger you will want to create, and supposes that you have some web 
          service somewhere that you want to add to your workflow. You need to 
          enter the location of the WSDL into the dialog that appears, and the 
          workbench should go away, look at the WSDL file, extract all available 
          port types and operations and display them in the service panel. </li>
        <li> <strong>Soaplab services</strong> - to add a new soaplab installation 
          to the service panel you need to specify the base URL to the soaplab 
          analysis service. For example, if your soaplab installation has its 
          analysis factory endpoint at http://foo.bar/soaplab/AnalysisWS then 
          you should give the argument http://foo.bar/soaplab/ to create the scavenger. 
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Talisman scripts</strong> - to add new scripts to the service 
          panel you right click, select 'new talisman scavenger' and enter the 
          URL for the tscript file. </li>
        <li> <strong>Nested workflows</strong> - to add new workflow definitions 
          which can then be either imported as a complete workflow or used as 
          a 'black box' component you should enter the URL for the xscufl definition 
          file in the obviously appropriate place. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <strong><font color="#0000CC"><a name="4b"></a>...import services from 
      my workflow into the service panel?</font></strong><br>
      The context menu described above to add new scavengers has an additional 
      option to collect scavengers from your current scuf model. This will attempt 
      to locate appropriate scavenger modules that would be capable of building 
      the processors found in your model definition. Specifically, it will look 
      for any references to WSDL documents it doesn't already know about and import 
      those. </li>
    <li><font color="#0000CC"><strong><a name="4c"></a>...find workflows etc?</strong></font><br>
      Although we intend in the longer term to link this functionality into the 
      find service and the various service registries (myGrid, biomoby, UDDI etc) 
      you can currently use the rather quick and sysadmin enraging hack built 
      into the editor. Specifically, you can instigate a web crawl which will 
      attempt to locate xscufl and tscript files and add them to the scavenger 
      panel. Accessible from the 'collect from web' context menu in the services 
      panel, this is pointed as a default at the myGrid cvs web server, and will 
      find all of Peter's workflows.</li>
    <li> <strong><font color="#0000CC"><a name="4d"></a>...create a new service 
      in the workflow?</font></strong><br>
      Assuming you have correctly created the appropriate scavenger (see above), 
      you should be able to add an instance of any service within the service 
      selection panel by expanding the service selection tree until you have a 
      processor factory node (denoted by the coloured chip icons). Right clicking 
      on this node will give you a menu with the 'add to workflow' option, selecting 
      this will in turn give you a dialog requesting a name for the new service, 
      assuming your name is valid (i.e. alphanumeric plus the underscore character 
      and not matching anything already in the workflow) this will create a new 
      processor in the workflow; the addition should be reflected immediately 
      in any view components you have open. </li>
    <li> <strong><font color="#0000CC"><a name="4e"></a>...change the description 
      or the amount of logging my service provides?</font></strong><br>
      To alter the properties (description and log level) of a service in the 
      workflow you should select the 'properties...' option from the context menu 
      of the processor you want to change in the Scufl Model Explorer panel. This 
      will then display a properties pane for that processor, allowing you to 
      edit the description, change the log level and view the other properties 
      specific to that processor instance. </li>
    <li><a name="4f"></a> <strong><font color="#0000CC">...link services in the 
      workflow together?</font></strong><br>
      You link two processors, or a processor and an external port, by using the 
      context menu in the Scufl Model Explorer panel. Specifically, you always 
      link from an output port to an input port, so the link menu will only appear 
      if you click on an output port (or a workflow input). If you cannot see 
      any output ports, you may need to expand the processor node to show them. 
      Right clicking on an output port brings up a menu from which you can select 
      an input port to link to, selecting the port will create the link, and the 
      views should reflect the change. </li>
    <li> <strong><font color="#0000CC"><a name="4g"></a>...create new workflow 
      inputs and outputs?</font></strong><br>
      The 'Workflow inputs' and 'Workflow outputs' nodes in the Scufl Model Explorer 
      have an option in their right click menus to create a new input or output. 
      Selecting this option will bring up a dialog box into which you must enter 
      the name for the port. Assuming your name is valid, the port will be created 
      and the views will reflect the change. </li>
    <li><a name="4h"></a> <font color="#0000CC"><strong>...load and save workflow 
      definitions?</strong></font><br>
      The 'file' menu in the top level menu bar provides these functions. You 
      can import a workflow into the existing model (note that this does not clear 
      the model, it adds components subject to name clashes), save the current 
      model as XScufl, save as dot (three versions, choose the one you want from 
      the submenu) or clear the current model. If you want to completely restart 
      the model from a new workflow, you'll need to clear it then import. </li>
    <li><a name="4i"></a> <strong><font color="#0000CC">...load a workflow from 
      the web?</font></strong><br>
      The 'file' menu contains an option to load an XScufl definition file from 
      a URL. You simply enter the URL to your definition and the editor will import 
      it into the model. Alternatively, if the workflow has already been located 
      as a nested workflow in the service selection panel you can add it from 
      there, right click on the workflow in the tree and select 'import workflow' 
      from the menu. </li>
    <li><a name="4j"></a> <font color="#0000CC"><strong>...delete things from 
      my workflow?</strong></font><br>
      In general if it is possible to delete something from the workflow there 
      will be a 'remove from model' option in the right click menu available from 
      the Scufl Model Explorer panel. To completely reset the workflow you should 
      use the 'Reset model data' option in the 'file' menu of the main window. 
    </li>
    <li><a name="4k"></a> <strong><font color="#0000CC">...create coordination 
      constraints?</font></strong><br>
      The only kind of coordination constraint the enactor currently supports 
      is one that prevents a processor moving from scheduled to running until 
      another processor has completed. To create an instance of this kind of constraint, 
      you can use the context menu on a processor node in the scufl model explorer 
      panel. Select the processor that you want to be controlled by the constraint, 
      then choose the processor that guards the state transition from the submenu, 
      you should see the new constraint in any open views you happen to have. 
    </li>
    <li><a name="4l"></a> <strong><font color="#0000CC">...change the graphical 
      display?</font></strong><br>
      There are three possible policies for the graphical display; display no 
      ports, only display bound ports and display everything. If you right click 
      on the graphic display panel you should see a menu, choose the appropriate 
      policy and the display will update. The default value is to show only bound 
      ports, this is a sensible comprimise between information richness and diagram 
      size, but the other values have their uses. Have a play. In addition to 
      this, you can tell the display to scale to the window, but be aware that 
      this is highly non optimized (read, horribly slow on some machines). </li>
    <li> <font color="#0000CC"><strong><a name="4m"></a>...run the workflow?</strong></font><br>
      In order to run a workflow you must open the Workflow Input Panel from the 
      view menu. Into this you should be able to enter the input data, either 
      editing it directly, loading from a file or loading from a URL. For information 
      only you can view the resultant input document, or click the 'play' icon 
      to launch the enactor locally. This will in turn show an enactor run dialog 
      containing the statii of the processors, results assuming the workflow terminates 
      successfully and provenance information in any case. </li>
  </ul>
