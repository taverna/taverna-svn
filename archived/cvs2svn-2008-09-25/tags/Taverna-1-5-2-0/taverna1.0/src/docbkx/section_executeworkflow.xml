  <title>Executing a workflow without the GUI</title>

  <para>There is a utility script called executeworkflow.sh or
  executeworkflow.bat that allows a workflow to be executed outside of the
  Taverna workbench.</para>

  <para>The minimum requirement is to provide the name, or URL, to the
  workflow scufl document. The default behaviour is to save the workflow
  results into a directory with the same name of the workflow appended with
  _output. Within this directory is store the progress report of the workflow,
  and additional directories that contain the actual results. These
  directories are named after the workflow output names. Be aware that
  existing results are automatically overwritten if they exist.</para>

  <para>Supplying inputs and modifying the default behaviour can be achieved
  with the following options.</para>

  <simplelist>
    <member>-help displays this list of options.</member>

    <member>-input &lt;name&gt; &lt;filename&gt; load the named input from a
    file or URL.</member>

    <member>-inputdoc &lt;filename&gt; loads inputs from an XML
    document.</member>

    <member>-outputdoc &lt;filename&gt; saves the outputs to a new XML
    document.</member>

    <member>-output &lt;directory&gt; save outputs as files in
    directory.</member>

    <member>-report &lt;filename&gt; save the progress report to an XML
    document.</member>
  </simplelist>

  <para>If outputs are stored as a single XML document, these results can be
  viewed using the dataviewer utility. This is used using the dataviewer
  script that can be found in the same location as executeworkflow.</para>
