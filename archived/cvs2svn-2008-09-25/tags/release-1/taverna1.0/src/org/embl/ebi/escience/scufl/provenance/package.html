<p>Provides facilities for extracting and comprehending provenance information 
  from a workflow instance. This information is split into two sections, provenance 
  of the process and provenance of the data. In myGrid terms the former is more 
  like a status report and the latter the true provenance record.</p>
<p>Provenance of the process is defined in this case as the complete history of 
  all state changes and their associated metadata for each processing entity within 
  the workflow. The current state of the workflow can be extracted by taking the 
  head of each of these lists. Events corresponding to state changes are expressed 
  internally as specific ProcessEvent objects, and to the outside world as an 
  XML document.</p>
<p>Provenance of the data is recorded and stored in the form of RDF statements 
  about data objects identified by the LSID scheme. We have not yet fixed the 
  interface for the storage of these data, or access to the LSID authority to 
  acquire IDs.</p>
