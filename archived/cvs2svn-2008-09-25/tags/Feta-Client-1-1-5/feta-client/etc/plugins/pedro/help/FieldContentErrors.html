<h1>Field Content Errors</h1>
This category of errors means that the value for some edit field is
invalid.  Pedro tells you about these errors every time you press
"Keep" in the field panel.  It also validates edit fields when you
save, exit, or try to move to another record.  The Pedro Validation
Dialog can be used outside the context of the application and
configured to scan for edit field errors everywhere in the record
tree.  The following are examples of circumstances that would be
field content errors:

<ul>
<li>
A required field is left blank.
</li>
<li>
You've typed letters in a number field
</li>
<li>
you've entered a number value that lies beyond an accepted upper or
lower limit.
</li>
<li>
You're typing 
</li>

</ul>
