<h1>Duplicate References</h1>
Some records you create can be referenced by others.  A record can be
referenced if you see at least one field with a "Generate Key"
button.  The purpose of having these fields is to uniquely identify
the record.  You can type in your own key value or you can press
"Generate Key" and get Pedro to provide you with a unique key.

<p>
In rare cases, a record may have more than one reference field.  Each
of the identifier values will uniquely identify the record.  However,
Pedro will use the first identifier value it encounters.  

<p>
Unique identifiers are supposed to be unique with respect to all other
identifier values used in the document.  When Pedro writes data out to
a file, it writes out these values to indicate that one record
points to another.  If there are two identifiers with the same value,
Pedro will get confused when it tries to read the file.

<p>
Duplicate references can arise under the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>
You've copied a subtree that contains identifier values that have been
used elsewhere in the tree
</li>
<li>
You're loading a template that contains identifier values that have
been used elsewhere in the tree
</li>
<li>
You've been handcrafting your own identifiers and you've mistakenly
assigned the same identifier value to more than one record.
</li>
<li>
You've been using the "Generate Key" button, but decided to go edit
the generated value.
</li>

</ul>
