<h1>Import from XML </h1>

<p>
imports from an XML file.  Most of the time, Pedro loads and saves
"*.pdz" files.  Users will probably want to <a
href="./ExportToXML.html">export to XML</a> if they're submitting a
data file to a data repository.  This feature exists for situations
where the user wants to edit one of those XML format files.  

<h3>Why isn't this feature available all the time?</h3>
This feature will only be available for schemas which are not
considered "ambiguous".

<p>
The XML export format writes your records in such a way that the files
can be mechanically validated against an XML Schema.  This validation
activity is likely to be done by people who maintain data repositories.

<p>
The XML export files often do not contain enough information for the
application to reconstitute the file in a window. "*.pdz" files store
your records, as well as markers that tell the application which list
field to put subrecords in.  Without these markers, Pedro might
encounter an ambiguous schema and not know what to do.

<p>
<b>
A data model is <i>ambiguous</i> if some record has more than one list field
that can each contain the same kind of subrecord.
</b>
<p>
If the data model you're using is ambiguous, the feature will be
disabled.  Otherwise, Pedro uses a bit of logic to figure out which
list fields contain which subrecords.
