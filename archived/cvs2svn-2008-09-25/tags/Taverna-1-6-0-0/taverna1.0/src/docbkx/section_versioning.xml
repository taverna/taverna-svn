  <title>Taverna versioning guidelines.</title>

  <para>Taverna releases use the following versioning
  rules.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>1st order: X - A signifact change in the Taverna API, and its
      internal architecture. Taverna 2.0 will be a significant new
      release.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>2nd order: 1.x- A significant change that includes large pieces of
      new functionality and also some possible minor changes to the API.
      Plugins may need their code modifying to continue to work
      correctly.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>3rd order: 1.5.x - A change that affects the key core artifacts of
      Taverna. Changes these core artifacts require that Plugins need to have
      their dependencies updated to continue to work correctly, though minimal
      code changes.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>4th order: 1.5.1.x - A minor update, that contains bugfixes that
      do not affact Taverna core artifacts. A Plugin will be compatible across
      different versions without requiring any changes.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>Taverna artifacts for a given release will follow the 3rd order version of
  Taverna. So all artifacts in Taverna 1.5.1 will have the version 1.5.1.x.
  When a new Taverna release is made that affects the 3rd order version number, all
  artifacts will have their versions updated to remain synchronised.</para>
