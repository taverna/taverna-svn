<h1>Show Errors</h1>

<p>
Causes subrecords containing errors to highlight.  There are two types
of errors:

<ul>
<li>the current record contains an improper field value</li>
<li>a record is missing a required subrecord.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Records that are missing required subrecords will show faint yellow
items in dashed boxes.  These are "ghost records" that tell you what
kind of record you need. The application will not allow you to save
files that contain records with errors in record field values.
However, it will allow you to save partial files, even if the data
model designers have decided that a record requires a certain subrecord.

<p>
Press <a href="./Clear.html">Clear</a> to clear the display.
