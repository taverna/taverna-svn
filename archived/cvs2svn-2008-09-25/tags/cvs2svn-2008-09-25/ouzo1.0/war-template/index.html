<h1 align="justify">Taverna LSID Authority Service</h1>
<p align="justify"><em><a href="mailto:tmo@ebi.ac.uk">tmo@ebi.ac.uk</a></em>, 
  2<sup>nd</sup> March 2004, v0.1alpha1</p>
<hr align="JUSTIFY">
<p align="justify">This is the index page for an installation of the Taverna LSID 
  Authority Service. This service is an implementation of the <a href="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/lsid/?Open&ca=daw-ws-dr">OMG 
  Life Science Identifier specification</a>, and is used to provide access to 
  the various data produced by Taverna in a portable fashion.</p>
<p align="justify">LSID values stored in this service take the following forms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>urn:lsid:net.sf.taverna:datathing:<em>identifier</em></li>
  <li>urn:lsid:net.sf.taverna:raw:<em>identifier</em></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">The datathing form of the identifier allows access to the XML 
  data document format defined by the baclava subproject within Taverna. This 
  format encapsulates arbitrary collection structures and their metadata into 
  one single blob of XML, the corresponding object model is used within the workflow 
  engine to transport and process data. For this reason, if you are feeding data 
  into a workflow it is natural to use the datathing form.</p>
<p align="justify">The raw form may or may not be available, it only exists if 
  it is also possible to retrieve the datathing form for that identifier and if 
  the part within the datathing is a leaf node. This is because there is no obvious 
  natural form for an array of images for example. It does, however, allow you 
  to fetch the bytes corresponding to any leaf node within a data object, and 
  is therefore useful when you do not wish to process the baclava document types 
  in your own code.</p>
<p align="justify">If there are problems with the service, you may want to check 
  that the underlying Axis engine is correctly configured, checking <a href="happyaxis.jsp">here</a> 
  will give you some basic checks on library status although these are not sufficient 
  of themselves to guarantee functionality. This server is based on version 1.0.1 
  of the LSID software.</p>
<p align="justify">Any questions about this service please email Tom Oinn (<a href="mailto:tmo@ebi.ac.uk">tmo@ebi.ac.uk</a>)</p>
<hr align="JUSTIFY">
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>In order to connect the authority to the underlying data store you will need 
  to change various parameters within the services/taverna-services.xml file, 
  these include the JDBC driver class, connection URL and user/password pair to 
  access the RDBMS. The code has been written for the mySQL database, it's unlikely 
  that it will work out of the box with anything else.</p>
<p>If you don't already have a data store running then all you need to do is create 
  a blank database schema, reference it in the connection url and ensure that 
  the user specified can create new tables - the first invocation of the data 
  service will create any missing tables appropriately.</p>
