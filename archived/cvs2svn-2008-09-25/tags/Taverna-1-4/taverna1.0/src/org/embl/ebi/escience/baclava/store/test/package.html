<p>Tests the storage API and implementation. The test requires you to have a MySQL 
  server running, and to have configured the mygrid.properties file in the workbench 
  directory correctly to suit. It can be run with '<code>ant test.store</code>', 
  it stores a DataThing into the backing store and then fetches all the subcomponents 
  of it back using the storage API. For obvious reasons the version of the config 
  in CVS has bogus passwords etc, you <em>will</em> need to configure it before 
  it will run! </p>
