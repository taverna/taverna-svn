<h1>Todo list for Taverna reliability and fault tolerance</h1>
<p>This document sets out the deliverables and intermediate points required to 
  enhance the behaviour of Taverna and FreeFluo under failure conditions, including 
  service and network errors, along with features required to support these aims 
  such as workflow engine capability reporting, limited federation, workflow hibernation 
  and detailed fault and progress analysis. Items are numbered heirarchically, 
  incomplete actions coloured in red, complete ones in blue.</p>
<p>These items are considered as deliverables for Taverna b8, so we should aim 
  to have as many of them as possible completed by the end of Feb (at which point 
  the project will be a year old!)</p>

<h2>1 Workflow enactment service</h2>
<p>The enactor service needs to support additional methods for long running workflows, 
  the interogation of workflow instances for intermediate results and for federation.</p>
<h3>1.1 Intermediate results, reliability.</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1.1.1 getIntermediateResultsForProcessor(String workflowInstnaceID, 
    String processorName)</strong> <br>
    This method should return an array containing two strings, the first string 
    being the baclava format document corresponding to the current input values 
    for this processor, the second being the same but for any outputs. Effectively 
    this queries the immediate parents and children of the ProcessorTask associated 
    with the named SCUFL Processor object, determines whether these related nodes 
    contain data, and, if so, copies their values into the status documents.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1.1.1.1</strong> <font color="#0000FF">action - implement within 
        TavernaFlowReceipt</font></li>
      <li><strong>1.1.1.2</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - expose in workflow 
        enactment service interface</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>1.1.2 requestWorkflowInstanceLease(String workflowInstanceID, int 
    millisecondsLeaseTime) </strong><br>
    Requests that the given workflow not be evicted for at least the specified 
    time. This allows workflow clients to use the intermediate state querying 
    operations safely without having to consider that the workflow might have 
    been evicted under their feet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.2 Federation and enactor location.</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1.2.1 getWorkflowEngineCapabilityDocument()</strong><br>
    Returns an XML document describing which processor types the enactor queried 
    supports. In addition, this document should include build versions and dates 
    for both the enactor core and the Taverna extensions.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1.2.1.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - define XML format 
        for capability document</font></li>
      <li><strong>1.2.1.2</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - implement functionality 
        within Taverna to get Taverna specific version information</font></li>
      <li><strong>1.2.1.3</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - expose 1.2.1.2 
        in the workflow enactment service interface</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>2 Status document format</h2>
<p>The status document returned by the enactor operations currently has no mechanism 
  for reporting retries, we need to enhance the document format such that we can 
  express more information of this form. Specifically we should aim to allow the 
  following information</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>2.1</strong> What each processor is currently waiting for, i.e. 
    'Scheduled and waiting for available input data on port name <em>sequenceID</em>' 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2.1.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - define XML fragment 
        format for this information</font></li>
      <li><strong>2.1.2</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - implement getDetailedStatusForProcessor 
        or similar in TavernaFlowReceipt </font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>2.2</strong> For failure cases, we should be more descriptive if 
    possible - there may well be ontologies of failure classes out there that 
    we could reuse. This would allow us to distinguish between, say, network failures, 
    data driven errors and systemic failured in the target service components. 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2.2.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - locate and investigate 
        ontologies or other cv for failure states</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>2.3</strong> We need to be able to express 'Failed initial invocation, 
    waiting to retry in 20 seconds, attempt 3 of 5' and similar. 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2.3.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - define XML fragment 
        format for this information</font></li>
      <li><strong>2.3.2</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - implement this 
        functionality, probably within the ProcessorTask class </font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>2.4</strong> Implicit iteration could also usefully be reported, 
    not so much a reliability feature but we might as well consider it while we're 
    altering the report format. 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2.4.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - define XML status 
        for looping within an implicit iteration block</font> </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>3 Processor fault handling</h2>
<p>The ProcessorTask implementation needs to be modified to support various reliability 
  based features, in addition we need to consider how best to specify alternate 
  processors, either by explicit statements of the form 'processor A can be used 
  in the place of processor B within this workflow context' or by some more intelligent 
  lookup service capable of locating alternates based on some abstract specification. 
  This has possible ties with the enhanced UDDI service developed at Southampton 
  ECS, so we should probably talk to them about it as well.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>3.1</strong> Additional parameters are required for all processor 
    types 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>3.1.1</strong> Number of retries to attempt, defaulting to zero? 
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3.1.1.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - add attribute 
            to Processor class</font></li>
          <li><strong>3.1.1.2</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - add retry 
            behaviour to ProcessorTask class</font></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>3.1.2 </strong>Time in milliseconds to wait after a failure 
        before a reinvocation 
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3.1.2.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action, see 3.1.1.1</font></li>
          <li><strong>3.1.2.2</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action, see 3.1.1.2</font></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>3.1.3</strong> Behaviour in the event of a failure after the 
        retry limit has been exceeded 
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3.1.3.1</strong> Cancel workflow completely - the current 
            default behaviour</li>
          <li><strong>3.1.3.2 </strong>Abort immediate child processes</li>
          <li><strong>3.1.3.3</strong> Do nothing or remove result PortTask objects 
            from the DiGraph?</li>
          <li><strong>3.1.3.4</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - modify workflow 
            enactment core to allow these options</font></li>
          <li><strong>3.1.3.5</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - add 'on 
            failure' attribute to Processor class</font> </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>3.1.4</strong> Timeout behaviour, whether to flag the process 
        as failed if it doesn't return within a certain length of time. The default 
        for this is tricky, the current behaviour is equivalent to no timeout 
        which is the 'safe' case, I suspect that we'll want to leave this as the 
        default and allow users to set a timeout where they know there is a potentially 
        unreliable service that may require retries.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3.1.4.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - add attribute 
            to Processor to allow timeout definition</font></li>
          <li><strong>3.1.4.2</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - add logic 
            to ProcessorTask to implement timeouts</font></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>3.1.5</strong> Alternate processor specifications, it would 
        be great if, where possible, alternates to a given process could be specified 
        or automatically located. 
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3.1.5.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - where do 
            we hold the equivalence information? explicit declaration or by lookup?</font></li>
          <li><strong>3.1.5.2</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - related 
            to 3.1.5.1, do we require a service to perform the equivalence comparison, 
            if so we need to define the service interface and capabilities</font></li>
          <li><strong>3.1.5.2</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - determine 
            how the enactor can be modified to detect such possible alternates 
            and fail over to them</font></li>
          <li><strong>3.1.5.3</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - determine 
            how such failover should be represented in the provenance and status 
            reports</font></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>4 Workflow hibernation and persistance</h2>
<p>In order to successfully invoke long running workflows, we need a mechanism 
  to persist the intermediate state of the workflow. This is probably best accomplished 
  by implementing a backing store in the PortTask class, as this class effectively 
  acts as the data holder between ProcessorTask implementations, marshalling DataThing 
  objects and performing implicit iteration and type matching. This should, however, 
  be investigated working closely with the enactor group at IT Innovation, otherwise 
  we'll find ourselves reinventing the wheel and life's too short.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we already have a standard serialized form for all our data, as 
  this is provided by the various classes within the <em>baclava</em> and <em>baclava.factory</em> 
  packages. This should make it relatively simple to store and retrieve the intermediate 
  data values, it's just a question of exactly which bit of code actually does 
  this.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>4.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - determine where to locate 
    the persistence code within the codebase</font></li>
  <li><strong>4.2</strong> In some senses this functionality overlaps with the 
    concept of storing all intermediates alongside generated RDF metadata about 
    the process that derives them. After all, if you've already stored all this 
    as a side effect of running (or partially running) a workflow don't you already 
    have the state required for 4?</li>
  <li><strong>4.3</strong> If we have a global pause operation per workflow then 
    much of this is simplified, such a flag would be set or cleared on each workflow 
    instance, and when set would prevent any state changes. 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>4.3.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - implement pause 
        and resume operation of a workflow instance within the enactor</font></li>
      <li><strong>4.3.2 </strong><font color="#FF0000">action - expose this functionality 
        in the service interface (not sure of this one?)</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>4.4</strong> In order to suspend a workflow we need to store two 
    documents. The first of these is the XML representation of the scufl model 
    that the DiGraph was generated from. The second is a document containing all 
    known result values produced to date in the workflow. These data should be 
    extracted after a pause operation has been performed and all running processors 
    cancelled. 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>4.4.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - implement code 
        to examine a DiGraph instance and extract all intermediate values from 
        it to a baclava data document</font></li>
      <li><strong>4.4.2</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - implement code 
        to populate a DiGraph instance in a pause state from the document saved 
        in 4.4.1, then set processor states appropriately before clearing the 
        pause state and allowing the workflow instance to resume</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>4.5</strong> It could be the case that some services encapsulate 
    state external to the workflow instance, in which case the behaviour outlined 
    above would cause problems. We might want to have the ability to flag processors 
    with a 'transient' property which would exclude them from the list of candidates 
    for storage. In this case only processors with fully populated child nodes 
    and no transient status would be used to generate the intermediate state.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>4.5.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - add transient 
        flag to processors, document carefully!</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>5 Merge latest workflow enactment mechanism with Taverna</h2>
<p>The current Taverna builds use a somewhat outdated workflow library, it's in 
  our best interests to ensure that we're using a more recent one, even if not 
  the latest 'bleeding edge' version. This is especially true in light of the 
  items above which rely for their implimentation details upon the inner workings 
  of the enactor.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>5.1</strong> <font color="#FF0000">action - reconcile code differences 
    and move Taverna to the latest FreeFluo release </font></li>
</ul>
<h1>Change log</h1>
<strong>14<sup>th</sup> January 2004, tmo@ebi.ac.uk</strong> 
<ul>
  <li>Added 2.4, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and children to do with implicit iteration and 
    hibernation. These changes, especially those to section 4, allow us to consider 
    failover between enactor instances.</li>
