<h1>Welcome to Taverna</h1>
<p><em>Version 0.1.beta7, 2<sup>nd</sup> December 2003, <a href="mailto:tmo@ebi.ac.uk">tmo@ebi.ac.uk</a></em></p>
<h2>About the project</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The Taverna project aims to provide a language and software tools to facilitate 
    easy use of workflow and distributed compute technology within the eScience 
    community. As a component of the EPSRC funded <sup>my</sup>Grid project, Taverna 
    is available freely under the terms of the LGPL.</p>
  <p>Taverna is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute 
    (EBI), IT Innovation and the Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Center 
    (HGMP). Development is coordinated through the facilities generously provided 
    by SourceForge.net and driven by the requirements of biologists from the Newcastle 
    Centre for Life, amongst others.</p>
  <p>For more information, or to download the language specification, object model 
    and associated software, please select an appropriate item from the menu on 
    the left of this page.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Quickstart</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>To get playing with Taverna as quickly as possible we suggest you download 
    the binary version of the workbench (assuming that you are either on a win32 
    machine or that you are prepared to fiddle with the launch script). This will 
    give you a chance to build, edit and run workflows using the embedded workflow 
    enactment engine, see the workbench documentation in the menu to the left 
    for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What's new in beta7?</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>In this beta release we've added support for local services to perform operations 
    such as set union and intersection, fetch from URL, list filtering based on 
    regular expressions and similar. In addition, the implicit iteration support 
    that was removed for the new data model introduction is back, enabling automatic 
    iteration over data sets - wherever possible Taverna will now automatically 
    reconcile type cardinality mismatches and hopefully behave sensibly. The level 
    of complexity possible in workflows is significantly higher than previous 
    releases due mainly to these new features, there's a PDF file available that 
    shows a couple of examples of what is possible!</p>
  <p><em>Taverna Workflow Examples</em> - Adobe PDF Format - 345kb - <a href="SampleWorkflows.pdf">download 
    here</a></p>
  <p>We have also provided a page containing links to example web services deployed 
    around the world (Europe, Japan and the USA), use at your own risk (obviously) 
    but they might be useful if you're trying to go beyond the basic currency 
    converter style services availabe on xmethods.net. Use the 'example services' 
    link on the sidebar to take a look.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>We welcome your feedback, anything from a quick note commenting on our project 
    to offers of collaboration will be gratefully received. In particular we're 
    interested in hearing from anyone who thinks they might be able to use these 
    systems, after all, middleware is only worth having if someone is using it, 
    right?</p>
  <p>Cheers,</p>
  <p>Tom Oinn, Tim Carver, Justin Ferris, Darren Marvin, Mark Greenwood, Anil 
    Wipat, Peter Li</p>
