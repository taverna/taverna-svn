Entities within the workflow object model may be marked as annotated.
When marked as such they contract to provide one or more of a variety of
forms of metadata, whether generic or specific to the type of object
within the model. This description is deliberately kept vague for now
because we haven't yet enumerated what classes of annotation exist on
each entity.
<p>From this point in we will use the term 'metadata' to distinguish
between annotations in terms of properties of the workflow and
annotations in terms of the Java 5 language feature. This is
particularly important we we use Java Annotations to implement the
workflow annotations. Yay.
<p>In keeping with the read-only model of the API package all
metadata interfaces only specify the get methods for their respective
contents. Modification of metadata instances is performed through Edit
objects.
