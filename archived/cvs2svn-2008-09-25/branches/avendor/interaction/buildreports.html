<h1>Interaction Server<br/>Build Reports</h1>
<hr>
<p>The  build system generates various documents, this page provides links to these. Note that none of these links will be valid unless you have done a build from the main directory using : </p>
<pre>&gt; ant clean all </pre>
<p>Once this has been done the following are available:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="build/api/index.html">JavaDoc</a> for all classes. Check that all packages and classes have top level documentation and that all public methods describe their parameters properly. In cases where methods take particular controlled vocabularies (magic strings, bits of XML etc) please ensure that this is documented in the method javadoc or in some external document this javadoc references. </p>
  <p><a href="build/reports/html/index.html">JUnit test report</a> for all test cases. JUnit is used to perform unit testing over the codebase, all tests should pass in a correct build. If you find a bug which manifests in spite of all test cases succeeding you should write a test case which fails because of the bug, then fix the problem, ensuring that your test case now succeeds. Do not just fix the original problem, we'll have no way of knowing if it comes back.</p>
  <p><a href="build/reports/coverage/index.html">JCoverage report</a>, note that JCoverage is run on all classes apart from exceptions and the autogenerated JReleaseInfo class. The report highlights areas of the code which are not covered adequately by the unit tests in test/... Classes with significant proportions of red in the bars need better test coverage, if this is a class you have introduced please write tests for it! You can see the areas of the class that are not tested by clicking on the class name - lines with a yellow background are those not covered by a unit test. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please ensure that you add unit tests, javadoc etc as you go.</p>
