<h1>3<sup>rd</sup> Party Licenses </h1>
<p>The interaction server uses a number of tools, icons and libraries from third parties in both build and runtime. These are detailed below along with their licenses as far as we are aware of them.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Build and language tools</h3>
<p>The interaction server is writen in the Java language and is tested to work with versions 1.4.2_07 and 1.5.0_04 of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from Sun Microsystems. The home page for Java on Sun's website is at <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a></p>
<p>We use the Ant build system from the Apache Group to manage the compilation, invocation of tests and other build time activities, the version used in this case is 1.6.2 and is available from <a href="http://ant.apache.org">ant.apache.org</a> </p>
<p>Additional compile tools are the JUnit testing suite from <a href="http://www.junit.org">www.junit.org</a> which we use to perform unit testing of the core systems and as many of the plugins as feasible, and JCoverage GPL version from <a href="http://www.jcoverage.com">www.jcoverage.com</a> for analysis of the unit test coverage (the proportion of source code exercised by the set of defined test units). </p>
<p>JCoverage in turn relies on the Jakarta-ORO text processing library at <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro">jakarta.apache.org/oro</a>, the Jakarta Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) at <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel">jakarta.apache.org/bcel</a> and the Java GetOpt library at <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/getopt/">freshmeat.net/projects/getopt/</a>. These libraries are included in binary form within the build system in the 'devlib' directory alongside those containing the core JCoverage jar file. Licenses for these libraries are <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a> (for GetOpt) and <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License 2.0</a> for ORO and BCEL - assuming that the BCEL project has acquired this license as part of its move to Apache Jakarta. In compliance with these licenses the links above provide access to the source code of these components.</p>
<p>The Ant Doxygen library allows invocation of the native Doxygen tool as part of our build process if that tool is installed, the Ant task to link the two is hosted at <a href="http://ant-doxygen.sourceforge.net/index.php">ant-doxygen.sourceforge.net</a> and is available under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache Software License</a> (version unknown but probably 2.0). Doxygen itself is available from <a href="http://www.stack.nl/%7Edimitri/doxygen/">www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/</a> and can be used to augement Javadoc with collaboration diagrams etc. </p>
<p>The JReleaseInfo tool inserts an autogenerated class containing metadata about the build which is then accessible from the compiled libraries, the home is at <a href="http://jreleaseinfo.sourceforge.net/index.html">jreleaseinfo.sourceforge.net/</a> and license is the Apache Software License. </p>
<h3>Runtime Libraries</h3>
<p>The JDOM library is used for XML handling, this library is fetched from the IBiblio Maven repository when the 'fetchjars' ant target is invoked; we use version 1.0 of the library which may be found at <a href="http://www.jdom.org">www.jdom.org</a>. License is a modified Apache-style license, see <a href="http://www.jdom.org/docs/faq.html#a0030">www.jdom.org/docs/faq.html#a0030</a></p>
<p>Log4J is used to provide a simple and configurable logging infrastructure, we use version 1.2.8 which is available from <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j">logging.apache.org/log4j</a> although we should probably upgrade to the most recent 1.2.11 version. I assume this is also under Apache license, we fetch the jar file at runtime as with JDOM and BeanShell so this probably doesn't affect us in any case.</p>
<p>We make use of the various Jakarta Commons libraries, in particular commons-discovery for the service provider interface mechanism available at <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/discovery/">jakarta.apache.org/commons/discovery/</a></p>
<h3>Icon Set</h3>
<p>We use the Crystal icon set within the interaction server web page UIs to provide all our colourful shiny icons, many thanks to Everaldo for providing this resource to the academic and open source community. More details are available at <a href="http://www.everaldo.com">www.everaldo.com</a> and <a href="http://www.yellowicon.com">www.yellowicon.com</a>. </p>
