<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the source 
  for the Gene Ontology Visualisation Service 'goviz', running the build script 
  should produce a file 'goviz.war' which may be deployed into your servlet engine 
  of choice, provided that that engine gives access to the JavaBean Activation 
  Framework, the JAXRPC APIs and the SAAJ, normally found in activation.jar, jaxrpc.jar 
  and saaj.jar respectively. These libraries cannot be included in this build 
  because they have to live in special endorsed directories within the server.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This service will 
  only function within the EBI LAN as it requires direct access to the Oracle 
  servers. Once deployed, access the default index page for the deployed application 
  for more details on how to use the API, or see the index.html inside the 'ws-template' 
  directory.</font></p>
