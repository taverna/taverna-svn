 Contains icons used by the Ocula UI, use the Icons.getIcon method to include them in the components. The icons in this directory are taken from the 'Crystal' set, as far as I'm aware these are open source, they were originally intended for the KDE but actually suit the needs of Ocula pretty much perfectly as well :).
