<p>Provides an API for connecting a workflow enactor to a suitable LSID authority 
  and RDF store in order to record and store intermediate data and their metadata 
  in a form browsable by eg. Haystack.</p>
<p>This package will also include a naive in memory store and authority that can 
  be used as a proxy to the real service based versions to reduce network access 
  latencies. </p>
