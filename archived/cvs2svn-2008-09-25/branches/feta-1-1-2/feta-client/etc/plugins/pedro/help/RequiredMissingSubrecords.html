<h1>Required Missing Subrecords</h1>
When you see a list field that has a field name in bold type, it means
that the list must have at least one item in it.  Pedro lets you save
your file from session to session without having to fill these fields
in.  There may be times when you simply don't have the data available
to fill in a new sub record.

<p>
However, when you think you're finished your file, Pedro will alert
you of errors where you have forgotten to create a required subrecord.
