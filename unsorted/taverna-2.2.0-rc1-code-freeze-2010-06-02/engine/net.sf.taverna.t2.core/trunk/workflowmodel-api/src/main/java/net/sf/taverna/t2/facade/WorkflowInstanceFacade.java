 * The interaction point with a workflow instance. Technically there is no such
 * thing as a workflow instance in Taverna2, at least not in any real sense in
 * the code itself. The instance is more literally an identifier used as the
 * root of all data and error objects within this workflow and by which the top
 * level DataFlow or similar object is identified in the state tree. The
 * implementation of this interface should hide this though, automatically
 * prepending the internally stored (and hidden) identifier to all data push
 * messages and providing a subtree of the state model rooted at the internal
 * ID.
 * <p>
 * TODO - we should probably have callbacks for failure states here, but that
 * would need a decent definition (and maybe even ontology of) what failure
 * means. It's less obvious in a data streaming world what a failure is. At the
 * moment the dispatch stack can potentially treat unhandled error messages as
 * failing the processor, how do we get this exception information back up to
 * the workflow level?
