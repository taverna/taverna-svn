This is just a zip file of the NetBeans project for the portal (hence why some of the names don't make too much sense!)
and why there's a lot of extra garbage that isn't used including some left over stuff when I was 'experimenting'.

All the JSPs (from which the platform is running) are in web\WEB-INF\jsp the important ones are affixed with _view
The Java files are in src\java\com\test
