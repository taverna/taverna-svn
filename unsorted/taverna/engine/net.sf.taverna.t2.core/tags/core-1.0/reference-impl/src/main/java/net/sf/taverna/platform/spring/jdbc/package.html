Extensions to the JDBC parts of Spring, and support for proxying of JDBC 
drivers so we can load them dynamically from raven artifacts. The proxy 
approach is inspired by http://www.jroller.com/tackline/entry/dynamically_loading_jdbc_drivers 
with additions to build from raven rather than from existing jar files.
