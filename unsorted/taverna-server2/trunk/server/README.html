<h1>Taverna Server 2.3 alpha README</h1>
<p>This is the prototype of the Taverna Server 2.3.</p>
<h2>Known Issue Workarounds</h2>
<p>If you are installing this code into Tomcat and you want to use
JMX MBeans to administer the TavServ component, you <b>must</b> make
sure that Tomcat gets the flag <tt>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote</tt>
set on the command line to prevent confusion about which internal JMX
server to use (this is a known issue between Tomcat and Spring). This
can be done by setting that value in the <tt>CATALINA_OPTS</tt>
environment variable on the command line, which in turn can be automated
by adding it to your startup script.</p>
<p>The line added might look like this on Unix systems:</p>
<pre>export CATALINA_OPTS=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote</pre>
