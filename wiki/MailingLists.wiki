#summary Taverna mailing lists

=Mailing lists=

To discuss Taverna, report bugs, get help, or any other issue, feel free to sign up to our [http://www.mygrid.org.uk/tools/taverna/taverna-mailing-lists/ mailing lists]. 

As a rule of thumb - use the list {{{taverna-hackers}}} for anything to do with the source code, APIs or building services for Taverna. On the other hand, use the list {{{taverna-users}}} for questions about the user interface, building workflows, finding services, etc.
