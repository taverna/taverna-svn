#summary Bugs and issues are tracked in Jira

= Issues =

We keep track of any bugs and issues using myGrid's [http://www.mygrid.org.uk/dev/issues/browse/T2 Jira] installation. 

However, we mainly prefer you to report bugs to our [MailingLists mailing lists], so that we can check the details of the issue, and also help other issues.
