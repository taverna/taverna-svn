#summary Bugs and issues are tracked in Jira

= Issues =

We keep track of any bugs and issues using myGrid's [http://www.mygrid.org.uk/dev/issues/browse/T2 Jira] installation. 

However, we mainly prefer you to report bugs to our [http://www.mygrid.org.uk/tools/taverna/taverna-mailing-lists/ mailing list]. As a rule of thumb - use the list {{{taverna-hackers}}} for anyting to do with the source code, APIs or building services for Taverna. On the other hand, use the list {{{taverna-users}}} for questions about the user interface, building workflows, finding services, etc.
