<h1>Undefined References</h1>
Some records you create can be referenced by others.  A record can be
referenced if you see at least one field with a "Generate Key"
button.  The purpose of having these fields is to uniquely identify
the record.  You can type in your own key value or you can press
"Generate Key" and get Pedro to provide you with a unique key.

<p>
In rare cases, a record may have more than one reference field.  Each
of the identifier values will uniquely identify the record.  However,
Pedro will use the first identifier value it encounters.  

<p>
When Pedro writes data out to a file, it writes out these values to
indicate that one record points to another.  If the identifier value
is blank, Pedro has difficulty figuring out how to reference the
record.  The application will get confused when it tries to read the file.

<p>
Undefined references can arise under the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>
You assign an identifier field a value.  Then you reference it.  Then
for some reason you go back and clear the identifier field value.
</li>
</ul>
