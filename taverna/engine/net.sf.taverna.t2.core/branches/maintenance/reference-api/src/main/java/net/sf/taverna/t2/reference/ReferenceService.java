/**
 * Top level access point to the reference manager for client code which is
 * aware of references and error documents. Provides methods to store and
 * retrieve instances of ReferenceSet, IdentifiedList&lt;T2Reference&gt; and
 * ErrorDocument. Acts as an integration layer for the three sub-component
 * service, providing in addition collection traversal and retrieval of lists of
 * identified entities (ReferenceSet, IdentifiedList&lt;Identified&gt; and
 * ErrorDocument) from a T2Reference identifying a list.
 * <p>
 * Also provides registration and retrieval logic for POJOs where supported by
 * appropriate plug-in instances, these methods can be used by code which is not
 * 'reference aware' to store and retrieve value types transparently.
 * <p>
 * Resolution of collections can happen at three different levels:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The embedded {@link ListService} resolves the collection ID to a list of
 * child IDs, and doesn't traverse these children if they are themselves lists.
 * Use the {@link #getListService()}.{@link ListService#getList(T2Reference) getList()}
 * to call this method directly on the list service if you need this
 * functionality, returning a list of {@link T2Reference}</li>
 * <li>The
 * {@link #resolveIdentifier(T2Reference, Set, ReferenceContext) resolveIdentifier}
 * method in this service instead resolves to a fully realized collection of the
 * entities which those IDs reference, and does recursively apply this to child
 * lists, resulting in a nested collection structure where the leaf nodes are
 * ReferenceSet and ErrorDocument instances and non-leaf are IdentifiedList of
 * Identified (the super-interface for IdentifiedList, ReferenceSet and
 * ErrorDocument). Use this method if you want to access the
 * ExternalReferenceSPI and ErrorDocument entities directly because your code
 * can act on a particular reference type - in general in these cases you would
 * also be using the augmentation system to ensure that the required reference
 * type was actually present in the collection structure.</li>
 * <li>The third level of resolution is to render the identifier through
 * {@link #renderIdentifier(T2Reference, Class, ReferenceContext) renderIdentifier}
 * to a nested structure as in
 * {@link #resolveIdentifier(T2Reference, Set, ReferenceContext) resolveIdentifier}
 * but where the structure consists of POJOs of the specified type and lists or
 * either list or the leaf type. This is used when your code is reference
 * agnostic and just requires the values in an easy to consume fashion. Note
 * that because this involves pulling the entire structure into memory it may
 * not be suitable for large data, use with caution. This method will, unlike
 * {@link #resolveIdentifier(T2Reference, Set, ReferenceContext) resolveIdentifier},
 * fail if the reference contains or is an error.</li>
 * </ol>

	 * <p>
	 * This method is only valid on parameters of the following type :
	 * <ol>
	 * <li>{@link T2Reference} - returned immediately as itself, this is needed
	 * because it means we can register lists of existing T2Reference</li>
	 * <li>{@link ReferenceSet} - registered if not already registered,

	 * <li>{@link ErrorDocument} - same behaviour as ReferenceSet</li>
	 * <li>{@link ExternalReferenceSPI} - wrapped in ReferenceSet, registered
	 * and ID returned</li>
	 * <li>Throwable - wrapped in {@link ErrorDocument} with no message,
	 * registered and ID returned</li>
	 * <li>List - all children are first registered, if this succeeds the list
	 * is itself registered as an {@link IdentifiedList} of {@link T2Reference}
	 * and its reference returned.</li>

	 * in this case any objects which do not match the above allowed list will
	 * be run through any available ValueToReferenceConvertorSPI instances in
	 * turn until one succeeds or all fail, which may result in the creation of
	 * ExternalReferenceSPI instances. As these can be registered such objects
	 * will not cause an exception to be thrown.

	 * @param o
	 *            the object to register with the reference system, must comply

	 *            within the top level type. If registering a collection this is

	 *            depth 1. Failing to specify this correctly will result in
