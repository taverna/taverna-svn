 * registered from a different class loader. We need to do this because the
 * DriverManager implementation uses native methods to hide drivers loaded by
 * other classloaders than the one used to construct the caller, this way we can
 * have a real JDBC driver loaded from a raven artifact and have an instance of
 * the proxy loaded through the platform acting as a view over it.
 * <p>
 * To use this you should use the {@link ProxyDriverManager}.
