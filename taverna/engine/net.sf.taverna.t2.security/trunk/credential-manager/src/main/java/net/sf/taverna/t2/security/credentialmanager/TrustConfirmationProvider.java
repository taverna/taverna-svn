/**
 * Defines an interface for providing ways to confirm/decline trust in a given service
 * (i.e. its public key certificate). 
 * <p>
 * Used by Credential Manager when looking up
 * the username and password for the service in its Keystore - if it cannot find 
 * anything it will loop through all providers until one can provide them. If none
 * can, the service invocation will (most probably) fail. 
 * <p>
 * A typical implementation of this class would pop up a dialog 
 * and ask the user for the password. Such providers should check
 * {@link GraphicsEnvironment#isHeadless()} before returning to avoid 
 * attempts to pop up dialogues on server/headless installations.
 * <p>
 * It is safe to return <code>null</code> if the provider does not have an
 * opinion.
