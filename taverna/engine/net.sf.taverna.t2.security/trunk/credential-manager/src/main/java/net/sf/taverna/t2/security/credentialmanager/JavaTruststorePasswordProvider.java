/**
 * Defines an interface for providing a password for Java's default truststore
 * located in JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts.
 * <p>
 * Used by Credential Manager when trying to copy the trusted certificates from the
 * Java's default truststore into the Credential Manageger's own Truststore. It will
 * first try the default Java passwords and then if they do not work - it will loop 
 * through all the providers until one can provide the password. If none
 * can, the certificates will not be copied. 
 * <p>
 * A typical implementation of this class would pop up a dialog 
 * and ask the user for the password. Such providers should check
 * {@link GraphicsEnvironment#isHeadless()} before returning to avoid 
 * attempts to pop up dialogues on server/headless installations.
 * <p>
 * It is safe to return <code>null</code> if the provider does not have an
 * opinion.
