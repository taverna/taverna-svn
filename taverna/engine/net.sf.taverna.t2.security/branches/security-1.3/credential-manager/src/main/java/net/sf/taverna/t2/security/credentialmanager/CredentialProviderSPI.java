/**
 * Defines an interface for providing credentials for the Credential Manager.
 * <p>
 * One typical implementation of this class would be able to pop up a user
 * interface for one or more methods. Such providers should check
 * {@link GraphicsEnvironment#isHeadless()} before returning true on any
 * canHandle/canProvide method, to avoid attempts to pop up dialogues on server
 * installations.
 * <p>
 * Providers must return a priority from {@link #getProviderPriority()},
 * allowing for multiple implementations of this SPI with partial
 * responsibilities..
 * <p>
 * Providers must respond <code>true</code> on the corresponding
 * canHandle/canProvide method in order to be asked. For instance, if a provider
 * returns true on {@link #canProvideMasterPassword()} and
 * {@link #canProvideUsernamePassword(URI)} it might be asked using
 * {@link #getMasterPassword()} and {@link #getUsernamePassword(URI, String)},
 * but would not be asked on {@link #shouldTrust(X509Certificate[])} or
 * {@link #getJavaTruststorePassword()}.
 * <p>
 * It is safe to return <code>null</code> if the provider does not have an
 * opinion, in which case the Credential Manager would ask a provider with a
 * lower priority that can handle the request.
