 * files containing one public key certificate; .cer are CER-encoded files
 * containing one ore more DER-encoded certificates; .crt files are either
 * encoded as binary DER or as ASCII PEM. .p7 and .p7c are PKCS #7 certificate
 * chain files (i.e. SignedData structure without data, just certificate(s)).
