<h3>API Consumer Tool</h3>
<p>The API Consumer Tool is a tool to allow Taverna to make use of the information in Java source files 
that is subsequently lost during compilation, such as parameter names within methods, JavaDoc comments 
and the like. It allows the user to select classes from a set of source files which are then exposed in 
the Taverna Workbench as services.</p>
<p>This package contains the classes required to build the user interface and query the JavaDoc object 
model to extract information about the selected classes. It uses the JDOM toolkit to construct an XML 
document which can be used by Taverna during workflow design and invocation.</p>
