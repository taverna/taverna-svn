/**
 * Visitor which can inspect a {@link WorkflowBean}.
 * <p>
 * Used with {@link WorkflowBean#accept(Visitor)} - in particular with
 * {@link WorkflowBundle#accept(Visitor)} to recursively visit every
 * WorkflowBean of a workflow bundle.
 * <p>
 * {@link #visitEnter(WorkflowBean)} will be called for each
 * {@link WorkflowBean} which has children, while {@link #visit(WorkflowBean)}
 * is called for leaf children.
 * <p>
 * For instance visiting using {@link Workflow#accept(Visitor)} will call
 * {@link #visitEnter(WorkflowBean)} with the workflow instance, followed by a
 * {@link #visit(WorkflowBean)} on each {@link InputWorkflowPort} and
 * {@link OutputWorkflowPort} (which are leaf nodes). Further
 * {@link #visitEnter(WorkflowBean)} will be called with a {@link Processor} -
 * which {@link Processor#accept(Visitor)} will recurse to
 * {@link InputProcessorPort} etc.
 * <p>
 * The visitor can avoid visiting a branch of the workflow by returning
 * <code>false</code> from {@link #visitEnter(WorkflowBean)}, or cancel the
 * iteration over children by returning <code>false</code> from
 * {@link #visit(WorkflowBean)} and {@link #visitLeave(WorkflowBean)}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link VisitorAdapter} class can be useful for avoiding to implement all
 * Visitor methods, while {@link VisitorWithPath} provides the
 * {@link VisitorAdapter#getCurrentPath()} .
