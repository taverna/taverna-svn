Implementations of entities which are persisted by Hibernate3. This is
part of the API package because it should be available on the context
classloader, but client code should not use anything in this package
directly. It's an open question whether this package should be part of
the API module or whether it should be in a module by itself - as there
is only one implementation of the reference management system and as
this package doesn't actually bring in any hibernate dependencies I'm
leaving it here to try to limit the module proliferation we're currently
suffering.
<p>To re-iterate : do <em>not</em> use any of the classes in this
package in your client code. They are only ever used directly by the
data access implementation objects.
