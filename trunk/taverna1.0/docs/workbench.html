<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This point 
  release of the Taverna project contains an application called the Scufl Workbench. 
  This is intended to allow you to create, edit and otherwise tinker with workflows 
  based on the Scufl language. It is not in its final form, but there is sufficient 
  editing functionality to produce new workflows that are at least vaguely functional. 
  An instance of the workbench contains exactly one Scufl model, and provides 
  zero or more arbitrary view and controller components over that model. It looks 
  something like this :</font></p>

  <pre align="justify"><font size="2">ant tools.workbench [-Dfile=your_workflow.xml]</font></pre>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The easiest 
    way to launch the workbench is from ant; obviously you could launch it directly 
    (the main class is org.embl.ebi.escience.scuflui.workbench.Workbench) but 
    you would have to add all the libraries to your classpath and ant takes care 
    of this automatically. If you specify a file as the 'file' parameter (or the 
    first argument if you're not using ant) this will be treated as an xscufl 
    definition file and the workbench will start off with the model populated 
    from this file. If you don't, you start off with an empty model. Note that 
    the tools.workbench task doesn't compile the code, so should only be run after 
    'ant jar'.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Available 
  components within the workbench</font></strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The workbench 
    is intended to act as a container to assorted user interface components. These 
    components act as either views, controllers or both on the underlying ScuflModel 
    instance. For example, the graphical view is only a view, the service panel 
    only a controller and the explorer an example of both roles. View components 
    respond to model events, so they will always display the current state of 
    the model, there is no need to explicitly refresh them. The available components 
    in this release are as follows.</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scufl model explorer<br>
      This shows the state of the current model as a tree. At the top level are 
      the different types of entities within a scufl model - overall workflow 
      inputs and outputs, processors, data links and coordination controls. Processor 
      nodes may be expanded to reveal their inputs and outputs. Most nodes have 
      context menus associated with them, see the 'how do I...' section for more 
      information, or just have a play around.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">XScufl view<br>
      This shows the current model as XScufl. This is what will be saved if you 
      select 'Save as XScufl' from the file menu. It is not editable, and merely 
      presents a view on the model.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dot view<br>
      Similarly to the XScufl view, this shows the dot text for the current model. 
      This was really only so I could figure out what was going wrong with the 
      graphical display, but you might find it interesting.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Graphical view<br>
      This shows a graphical view of the workflow. This view requires you to have 
      the dot tool and its associated libraries installed on your machine, and 
      present on the path, otherwise the application won't be able to find it. 
      This component sends the dot view to dot, reading the result back into a 
      buffered image and updating the display.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Available service panel<br>
      This panel shows potential processors that can be added to the workflow 
      model. It is entirely a controller, there is no workflow state reflected 
      in it. Initially it is configured to show the services available through 
      soaplab at the EBI, and also show the xembl service as an example of a WSDL 
      processor creator (I'm not sure whether the xembl service is actually maintained). 
      Context menus on this component allow you to add new processors to the workflow, 
      and also to add new scavengers - components that fetch sets of service factories 
      - to the service panel.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
    components may be displayed, or additional instances created, by selecting 
    the appropriate option from the 'view' menu in the main window. The 'file' 
    menu provides import, export and model reset operations.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How 
  do I...?</font></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="justify"><strong><font color="#9900FF">...add 
    my services to the service panel?</font></strong><br>
    You need to create a new scavenger. Right click on the 'Available Processors' 
    node at the top of the service panel. This should give you a menu from which 
    you can choose which type of scavenger you want.</font> 
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#000000">WSDL 
        services</font></strong> - this is the most common type of scavenger you 
        will want to create, and supposes that you have some web service somewhere 
        that you want to add to your workflow. You need to enter the location 
        of the WSDL into the dialog that appears, and the workbench should go 
        away, look at the WSDL file, extract all available port types and operations 
        and display them in the service panel.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#000000">Soaplab 
        services</font></strong> - to add a new soaplab installation to the service 
        panel you need to specify the base URL to the soaplab analysis service. 
        For example, if your soaplab installation has its analysis factory endpoint 
        at http://foo.bar/soaplab/AnalysisWS then you should give the argument 
        http://foo.bar/soaplab/ to create the scavenger. </font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="justify"><strong><font color="#9900FF">...create 
    a new service in the workflow?</font></strong><br>
    Assuming you have correctly created the appropriate scavenger (see above), 
    you should be able to add an instance of any service within the service selection 
    panel by expanding the service selection tree until you have a processor factory 
    node (denoted by the coloured chip icons). Right clicking on this node will 
    give you a menu with the 'add to workflow' option, selecting this will in 
    turn give you a dialog requesting a name for the new service, assuming your 
    name is valid (i.e. alphanumeric plus the underscore character and not matching 
    anything already in the workflow) this will create a new processor in the 
    workflow; the addition should be reflected immediately in any view components 
    you have open.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="justify"><strong><font color="#9900FF">...link 
    services in the workflow together?</font></strong><br>
    You link two processors, or a processor and an external port, by using the 
    context menu in the Scufl Model Explorer panel. Specifically, you always link 
    from an output port to an input port, so the link menu will only appear if 
    you click on an output port (or a workflow input). If you cannot see any output 
    ports, you may need to expand the processor node to show them. Right clicking 
    on an output port brings up a menu from which you can select an input port 
    to link to, selecting the port will create the link, and the views should 
    reflect the change.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="justify"><strong><font color="#9900FF">...create 
    new workflow inputs and outputs?</font></strong><br>
    The 'Workflow inputs' and 'Workflow outputs' nodes in the Scufl Model Explorer 
    have an option in their right click menus to create a new input or output. 
    Selecting this option will bring up a dialog box into which you must enter 
    the name for the port. Assuming your name is valid, the port will be created 
    and the views will reflect the change.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#9900FF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="justify"><strong>...load 
    and save workflow definitions?</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="justify"><br>
    The 'file' menu in the top level menu bar provides these functions. You can 
    import a workflow into the existing model (note that this does not clear the 
    model, it adds components subject to name clashes), save the current model 
    as XScufl, save as dot (three versions, choose the one you want from the submenu) 
    or clear the current model. If you want to completely restart the model from 
    a new workflow, you'll need to clear it then import.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#9900FF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="justify"><strong>...delete 
    things from my workflow?</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="justify"><br>
    In general if it is possible to delete something from the workflow there will 
    be a 'remove from model' option in the right click menu available from the 
    Scufl Model Explorer panel. To completely reset the workflow you should use 
    the 'Reset model data' option in the 'file' menu of the main window.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#9900FF">...edit 
    coordination constraints?</font></strong><br>
    You can't, I haven't implemented that bit yet. It'll be there before too long, 
    but if you need it really badly let me know and I'll make it more of a priority.</font></li>
