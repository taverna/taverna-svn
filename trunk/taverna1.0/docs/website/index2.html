<h1>Welcome to Taverna</h1>
<p><em>Version 0.1.beta5, 22<sup>nd</sup> September 2003, <a href="mailto:tmo@ebi.ac.uk">tmo@ebi.ac.uk</a></em></p>
<h2>About the project</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The Taverna project aims to provide a language and software tools to facilitate 
    easy use of workflow and distributed compute technology within the eScience 
    community. As a component of the EPSRC funded <sup>my</sup>Grid project, Taverna 
    is available freely under the terms of the LGPL.</p>
  <p>Taverna is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute 
    (EBI), IT Innovation and the Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Center 
    (HGMP). Development is coordinated through the facilities generously provided 
    by SourceForge.net</p>
  <p>For more information, or to download the language specification, object model 
    and associated software, please select an appropriate item from the menu on 
    the left of this page.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Quickstart</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>To get playing with Taverna as quickly as possible we suggest you download 
    the binary version of the workbench (assuming that you are either on a win32 
    machine or that you are prepared to fiddle with the launch script). This will 
    give you a chance to build, edit and run workflows using the embedded workflow 
    enactment engine, see the workbench documentation in the menu to the left 
    for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>We welcome your feedback, anything from a quick note commenting on our project 
    to offers of collaboration will be gratefully received. In particular we're 
    interested in hearing from anyone who thinks they might be able to use these 
    systems, after all, middleware is only worth having if someone is using it, 
    right?</p>
  <p>Cheers,</p>
  <p>Tom Oinn, Tim Carver, Justin Ferris, Darren Marvin</p>
