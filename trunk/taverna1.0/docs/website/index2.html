<h1>Welcome to Taverna</h1>
<p><em>Version 0.1.beta9, 6<sup>th</sup>April 2004, <a href="mailto:tmo@ebi.ac.uk">tmo@ebi.ac.uk</a></em></p>
<h2>About the project</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The Taverna project aims to provide a language and software tools to facilitate 
    easy use of workflow and distributed compute technology within the eScience 
    community. As a component of the EPSRC funded <sup>my</sup>Grid project, Taverna 
    is available freely under the terms of the LGPL.</p>
  <p>Taverna is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute 
    (EBI), IT Innovation and the Rosalind Franklin Centre for Genomic Research 
    (RFCGR). Development is coordinated through the facilities generously provided 
    by SourceForge.net and driven by the requirements of biologists from the Newcastle 
    Centre for Life, amongst others.</p>
  <p>For more information, or to download the language specification, object model 
    and associated software, please select an appropriate item from the menu on 
    the left of this page.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Quickstart + Tutorial</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>To get playing with Taverna as quickly as possible we suggest you download 
    the binary version of the workbench (assuming that you are either on a win32 
    machine or that you are prepared to fiddle with the launch script). This will 
    give you a chance to build, edit and run workflows using the embedded workflow 
    enactment engine, see the workbench documentation in the menu to the left 
    for more details.</p>
  <p>We will provide packages for MacOS X and i86 Linux as soon as possible, but 
    in the meantime it is possible for a relatively advanced user to download 
    the win32 package, modifying the batch files to suit the target operating 
    system.</p>
  <p>Peter Li has written a tutorial on how to get started with Taverna, you can 
    browse it <a href="tutorial/TavernaTutorial.htm">here</a></p>

<h2>What's new in Beta9?</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Beta9 includes various user interface fixes and error handling improvements. 
    Its main features, however, are tied into how it interacts with LSID authorities 
    and data sources. This functionality is turned off in the binary releases 
    as to do otherwise would require a rather more complex installation (two servers 
    are required to support these functions).</p>
  <p>This release was largely caused by an EPSRC pilot project meeting, if beta8 
    works for you then there's no huge reason to upgrade at the present time, 
    but expect to see major enhancements from this meeting in the next release.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What's new in beta8?</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>This release includes new reliability enhancements. Specifically, you can 
    now specify alternate processors, retry policies and such for any entity within 
    the workflow. There is more information on how to make use of these features 
    along with a simple tutorial.</p>
  <p><em>New Reliability Features</em> - Abobe PDF Format - 207kb - <a href="NewFeaturesForReliability.pdf">download 
    here</a></p>
  <p>Other new features include an enhanced results browser with configurable 
    views over the resulting data, better process reporting and logging, the ability 
    to batch save all workflow results to local disk on workflow completion, configurable 
    initial population of the service selection panel (see <code>conf/mygrid.properties</code>), 
    better user interface all round using native look and feel where possible 
    and assorted other changes.</p>
  <p>The other significant change for this and subsequent releases is an expansion 
    of the development team, with more myGrid people actively writing code for 
    Taverna. More information on the myGrid project can be found <a href="http://www.mygrid.info/">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What's new in beta7?</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>In this beta release we've added support for local services to perform operations 
    such as set union and intersection, fetch from URL, list filtering based on 
    regular expressions and similar. In addition, the implicit iteration support 
    that was removed for the new data model introduction is back, enabling automatic 
    iteration over data sets - wherever possible Taverna will now automatically 
    reconcile type cardinality mismatches and hopefully behave sensibly. The level 
    of complexity possible in workflows is significantly higher than previous 
    releases due mainly to these new features, there's a PDF file available that 
    shows a couple of examples of what is possible!</p>

    here</a></p>
  <p>We have also provided a page containing links to example web services deployed 
    around the world (Europe, Japan and the USA), use at your own risk (obviously) 
    but they might be useful if you're trying to go beyond the basic currency 
    converter style services availabe on xmethods.net. Use the 'example services' 
    link on the sidebar to take a look.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>We welcome your feedback, anything from a quick note commenting on our project 
    to offers of collaboration will be gratefully received. In particular we're 
    interested in hearing from anyone who thinks they might be able to use these 
    systems, after all, middleware is only worth having if someone is using it, 
    right?</p>
  <p>Cheers,</p>
  <p>Tom Oinn, Tim Carver, Justin Ferris, Darren Marvin, Mark Greenwood, Anil 
    Wipat, Peter Li, Matthew Pockock</p>
