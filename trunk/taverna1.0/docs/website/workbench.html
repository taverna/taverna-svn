<h2><a name="1"></a>About the Scufl Workbench</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>This point release of the Taverna project contains an application
called the Scufl Workbench. This is intended to allow you to create,
edit and otherwise tinker with workflows based on the Scufl language.
It is not in its final form, but there is sufficient editing
functionality to produce new workflows that are at least vaguely
functional. An instance of the workbench contains exactly one Scufl
model, and provides zero or more arbitrary view and controller
components over that model. It looks something like this : <br>

<h2><a name="2"></a>Launching the workbench </h2>
<blockquote>
  <pre>win32  : double click on the runme.bat<br>others : you'll need to launch it manually, examine the batch file (and contribute<br>         the script back!)</pre>
  <p>The binary release incorporates a copy of the win32 version of the
dot tool and its associated libraries. If you have java in your path
and are on a moderately recent version of windows you should be able to
simply double click on the batch file. Note that if you are behind a
firewall and require a web proxy, such as in Nottingham, you will need
to add the -Dhttp.proxyPort and http.proxyHost properties to the java
invocation in the batch file. If the application seems to hang whenever
you load a processor or a workflow this is the most likely cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="3"></a>Available components within the workbench</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The workbench is intended to act as a container to assorted user
interface components. These components act as either views, controllers
or both on the underlying ScuflModel instance. For example, the
graphical view is only a view, the service panel only a controller and
the explorer an example of both roles. View components respond to model
events, so they will always display the current state of the model,
there is no need to explicitly refresh them. The available components
in this release are as follows.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scufl model explorer<br>
This shows the state of the current model as a tree. At the top level
are the different types of entities within a scufl model - overall
workflow inputs and outputs, processors, data links and coordination
controls. Processor nodes may be expanded to reveal their inputs and
outputs. Most nodes have context menus associated with them, see the
'how do I...' section for more information, or just have a play around.</li>
    <li>XScufl view<br>
This shows the current model as XScufl. This is what will be saved if
you select 'Save as XScufl' from the file menu. It is not editable, and
merely presents a view on the model.</li>
    <li>Dot view<br>
Similarly to the XScufl view, this shows the dot text for the current
model. This was really only so I could figure out what was going wrong
with the graphical display, but you might find it interesting.</li>
    <li>Graphical view<br>
This shows a graphical view of the workflow. This view requires you to
have the dot tool and its associated libraries installed on your
machine, and present on the path, otherwise the application won't be
able to find it. This component sends the dot view to dot, reading the
result back into a buffered image and updating the display.</li>
    <li>Available service panel<br>
This panel shows potential processors that can be added to the workflow
model. It is entirely a controller, there is no workflow state
reflected in it. Initially it is configured to show the services
available through soaplab at the EBI, and also show the xembl service
as an example of a WSDL processor creator (I'm not sure whether the
xembl service is actually maintained). Context menus on this component
allow you to add new processors to the workflow, and also to add new
scavengers - components that fetch sets of service factories - to the
service panel</li>
    <li>Enactor launch panel.<br>
Allows you to specify inputs to the workflow and launch a local
instance of the enactor. This is actually sufficiently functional for
real use, but in particular for myGrid developers it provides a way to
test that your workflows can actually run.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These components may be displayed, or additional instances
created, by selecting the appropriate option from the 'view' menu in
the main window. The 'file' menu provides import, export and model
reset operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="4"></a>How do I ...? </h2>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><a name="4a"></a> <strong><font color="#0000cc">...add my
services to the service panel?</font></strong><br>
You need to create a new scavenger. Right click on the 'Available
Processors' node at the top of the service panel. This should give you
a menu from which you can choose which type of scavenger you want.
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>WSDL services</strong> - this is the most common
type of scavenger you will want to create, and supposes that you have
some web service somewhere that you want to add to your workflow. You
need to enter the location of the WSDL into the dialog that appears,
and the workbench should go away, look at the WSDL file, extract all
available port types and operations and display them in the service
panel. </li>
        <li> <strong>Soaplab services</strong> - to add a new soaplab
installation to the service panel you need to specify the base URL to
the soaplab analysis service. For example, if your soaplab installation
has its analysis factory endpoint at http://foo.bar/soaplab/AnalysisWS
then you should give the argument http://foo.bar/soaplab/ to create the
scavenger. </li>
        <li> <strong>Talisman scripts</strong> - to add new scripts to
the service panel you right click, select 'new talisman scavenger' and
enter the URL for the tscript file. </li>
        <li> <strong>Nested workflows</strong> - to add new workflow
definitions which can then be either imported as a complete workflow or
used as a 'black box' component you should enter the URL for the xscufl
definition file in the obviously appropriate place. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <strong><font color="#0000cc"><a name="4b"></a>...import
services from my workflow into the service panel?</font></strong><br>
The context menu described above to add new scavengers has an
additional option to collect scavengers from your current scuf model.
This will attempt to locate appropriate scavenger modules that would be
capable of building the processors found in your model definition.
Specifically, it will look for any references to WSDL documents it
doesn't already know about and import those. </li>
    <li><font color="#0000cc"><strong><a name="4c"></a>...find
workflows etc?</strong></font><br>
Although we intend in the longer term to link this functionality into
the find service and the various service registries (myGrid, biomoby,
UDDI etc) you can currently use the rather quick and sysadmin enraging
hack built into the editor. Specifically, you can instigate a web crawl
which will attempt to locate xscufl and tscript files and add them to
the scavenger panel. Accessible from the 'collect from web' context
menu in the services panel, this is pointed as a default at the myGrid
cvs web server, and will find all of Peter's workflows.</li>
    <li> <strong><font color="#0000cc"><a name="4d"></a>...create a
new service in the workflow?</font></strong><br>
Assuming you have correctly created the appropriate scavenger (see
above), you should be able to add an instance of any service within the
service selection panel by expanding the service selection tree until
you have a processor factory node (denoted by the coloured chip icons).
Right clicking on this node will give you a menu with the 'add to
workflow' option, selecting this will in turn give you a dialog
requesting a name for the new service, assuming your name is valid
(i.e. alphanumeric plus the underscore character and not matching
anything already in the workflow) this will create a new processor in
the workflow; the addition should be reflected immediately in any view
components you have open. </li>
    <li> <strong><font color="#0000cc"><a name="4e"></a>...change the
description or the amount of logging my service provides?</font></strong><br>
To alter the properties (description and log level) of a service in the
workflow you should select the 'properties...' option from the context
menu of the processor you want to change in the Scufl Model Explorer
panel. This will then display a properties pane for that processor,
allowing you to edit the description, change the log level and view the
other properties specific to that processor instance. </li>
    <li><a name="4f"></a> <strong><font color="#0000cc">...link
services in the workflow together?</font></strong><br>
You link two processors, or a processor and an external port, by using
the context menu in the Scufl Model Explorer panel. Specifically, you
always link from an output port to an input port, so the link menu will
only appear if you click on an output port (or a workflow input). If
you cannot see any output ports, you may need to expand the processor
node to show them. Right clicking on an output port brings up a menu
from which you can select an input port to link to, selecting the port
will create the link, and the views should reflect the change. </li>
    <li> <strong><font color="#0000cc"><a name="4g"></a>...create new
workflow inputs and outputs?</font></strong><br>
The 'Workflow inputs' and 'Workflow outputs' nodes in the Scufl Model
Explorer have an option in their right click menus to create a new
input or output. Selecting this option will bring up a dialog box into
which you must enter the name for the port. Assuming your name is
valid, the port will be created and the views will reflect the change. </li>
    <li><a name="4h"></a> <font color="#0000cc"><strong>...load and
save workflow definitions?</strong></font><br>
The 'file' menu in the top level menu bar provides these functions. You
can import a workflow into the existing model (note that this does not
clear the model, it adds components subject to name clashes), save the
current model as XScufl, save as dot (three versions, choose the one
you want from the submenu) or clear the current model. If you want to
completely restart the model from a new workflow, you'll need to clear
it then import. </li>
    <li><a name="4i"></a> <strong><font color="#0000cc">...load a
workflow from the web?</font></strong><br>
The 'file' menu contains an option to load an XScufl definition file
from a URL. You simply enter the URL to your definition and the editor
will import it into the model. Alternatively, if the workflow has
already been located as a nested workflow in the service selection
panel you can add it from there, right click on the workflow in the
tree and select 'import workflow' from the menu. </li>
    <li><a name="4j"></a> <font color="#0000cc"><strong>...delete
things from my workflow?</strong></font><br>
In general if it is possible to delete something from the workflow
there will be a 'remove from model' option in the right click menu
available from the Scufl Model Explorer panel. To completely reset the
workflow you should use the 'Reset model data' option in the 'file'
menu of the main window. </li>
    <li><a name="4k"></a> <strong><font color="#0000cc">...create
coordination constraints?</font></strong><br>
The only kind of coordination constraint the enactor currently supports
is one that prevents a processor moving from scheduled to running until
another processor has completed. To create an instance of this kind of
constraint, you can use the context menu on a processor node in the
scufl model explorer panel. Select the processor that you want to be
controlled by the constraint, then choose the processor that guards the
state transition from the submenu, you should see the new constraint in
any open views you happen to have. </li>
    <li><a name="4l"></a> <strong><font color="#0000cc">...change the
graphical display?</font></strong><br>
There are three possible policies for the graphical display; display no
ports, only display bound ports and display everything. If you right
click on the graphic display panel you should see a menu, choose the
appropriate policy and the display will update. The default value is to
show only bound ports, this is a sensible comprimise between
information richness and diagram size, but the other values have their
uses. Have a play. In addition to this, you can tell the display to
scale to the window, but be aware that this is highly non optimized
(read, horribly slow on some machines). </li>
    <li> <font color="#0000cc"><strong><a name="4m"></a>...run the
workflow?</strong></font><br>
In order to run a workflow you must open the Workflow Input Panel from
the view menu. Into this you should be able to enter the input data,
either editing it directly, loading from a file or loading from a URL.
For information only you can view the resultant input document, or
click the 'play' icon to launch the enactor locally. This will in turn
show an enactor run dialog containing the statii of the processors,
results assuming the workflow terminates successfully and provenance
information in any case. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="5"></a>Changing the way results are viewed</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>After launching a workflow, there will be lots of data flowing
through it. The Workflow Input Panel opens an enactor run dialog box
containing information about the current state of each processor. If
the workflow has terminated successfully, this will also display the
final results of the workflow.&nbsp; The final result, and intermediate
inputs and outputs are all displayed in the same way. The left-hand
side of the display shows an over-view of the data items. If there are
multiple items, this is shown as a tree. The right-hand side of the
display shows&nbsp; a detailed view of the data. If you click on an
item in the left-hand view, it will become the active item in the
right-hand side, replacing whatever was there before. This will be
displayed using the default viewer for that type. This may take into
account the mime-type of the data or any other information.<br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In different situations, you may wish to view the same data
type in a different way. For example, view a URL as a link, or as the
data at the end of the URL. Taverna supports this by allowing you to
select the viewer you wish to use. Right-click the data you wish to
view. This will bring up a pop-up menu. The menu will contain a
sub-menu called 'veiwers'. This contains a list of all viewers that are
registered for the current data-type. Selecting a viewer will change
how the data on the right-hand side is displayed, for example, allowing
you to view graphviz text as raw text rater than as a graph.</li>
    <li>The Table viewer allows you to display multiple data items in a
tabular form. Each row correspnds to one of the items, and each column
is a property of that data item. For example, you could display both
the raw text and the graphical view of graphviz text side-by-side. To
enable the table view, right-click the data item you wish to display.
If you want to display all of the data items, then click the folder
icon in the tree containing them all. Chose the "Table" option under
"Viewers". The righ-hand side of the display will now be replaced by a
table containing one column for each property of each data item. You
can manipulate the columns by right-clicking the column titles. There
are options to add and remove columns, change the name or the viewer
for that column, and to edit any options that alter how the data in the
column is extracted.</li>
    <li>Once you have added a new column, you can alter how it finds
the data by choosing the "Edit" option on the pop-up menu for that
column. This will bring up a dialog box that allows you to customise
the column. Each different type of column will have it's own dialog
box. For example, Regular expression columns will allow you to decide
upon the regular expression matched against the text. The results of
matches will then be displayed in the column.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
