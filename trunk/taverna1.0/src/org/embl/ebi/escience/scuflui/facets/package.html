Provides a Service Provider Interface (SPI) for decomposing objects into data
facets.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Data will be flowing arround taverna as opaque blobs. These may be annotated
with meta-data, such as their mime types. Often these data blobs can be
considered to have some properties. For example, the text of an embl entry has
properties like the ID, or organism. In a GUI or during some analysis, it
may be usefull to work with these facets, rather than with the object itself.
This package provides an SPI for decomposing objects into facets in a highly
configurable way.
</p>

<p>
The SPI API is defined totaly by one class and one interface.
{@link FacetFinderSPI}
defines the interface that must be implemented by a provider.
{@link FacetFinderRegistry}
 is a registry for all known facet finders.
There are additional classes, such as {@link RegexScanner} which are
implementations of this SPI, and these provide generic support for facetising
commonly encountered data items, such as strings.
