Provides a Service Provider Interface (SPI) for rendering the data in a
workflow.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The SPI API is defined totaly by one class and one interface.
{@link MimeTypeRenderSPI MimeTypeRenderSPI}
defines the interface that must be implemented by a provider.
{@link MimeTypeRendererRegistry MimeTypeRendererRegistry}
 is a registry for all known renderers.
There are additional classes in this package, such as
{@link TextRtf TextRtf}
which are implementations of the SPI, and these provide
support for rendering common data formats.
</p>

<p>
When data needs to be rendered, the GUI componet will use the registry to find
out which, if any, renderers are registered for that data type. The GUI may
optionaly chose to present the user with a list of possible renderers, or it
may just take the default.
</p>

<h2>The Registry</h2>

<p>
The registry is the way that most client code will discover what renderers are
available. The registry itself is impemented as a system-wide singleton. Use the
{@link org.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRendererRegistry#instance()}
method to get the registry. If
concurrency is an issue, you should synchronize on this instance.
</p>

<p>
The first part of the API provides list-like access to all registered
renderers through the
{@link org.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRendererRegistry#addRenderer()},
{@link org.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRendererRegistry#removeRenderer()},
{@link org.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRendererRegistry#size()},
{@link org.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRendererRegistry#get()} and
{@link org.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRendererRegistry#iterator()} methods.
You can use these to manually update and scan the available renderers.
</p>

<p>
The second part of the API is used to query for renderers by the data type.
{@link org.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRendererRegistry#getRenderer()} and
{@link org.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRendererRegistry#getRenderers()}
return the default SPI and
a list of all SPIs respectively for the given object and MIME type. This SPI
can then be used to create a GUI component that displays that data and MIME
type.
</p>

<h2>The SPI</h2>

<p>
The SPI interface, {@link org.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRenderSPI},
is very simple. It publishes a
name (which should remain constant), icon (conditioned on the data to display),
a method to see if the SPI can handle an
object and MIME type, and a factory method to create a GUI component for the
data object and MIME type.
</p>

<p>
As a user of the SPI, you can assume that if you obtained the renderer from one
of the registry lookup methods, that the renderer can handle that data. Calling
the factory method {@link org.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRenderSPI#getComponet()}
should just work. If
you are manually looping over some renderers, you should only call this method
on the renderers that return true for
{@link org.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRenderSPI#canHandle()}.
</p>

<h2>Writing an SPI implementation</h2>

<p>
If you have a new data type and wish to develop a renderer for it, you should
implement the {@link org.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRenderSPI}
interface and arrange for it to be
registered with the registry. You can name your SPI implementation in any way
you wish. Make sure it's a public class and has a public no-args constructor.
This is the constructor that will be called by the registry. Your SPI should be
thread-safe, as one instance of the SPI will be loaded into the registry and
used multiple times, possibly with parallel invocations.
</p>

<p>
Ensure that the canHandle() method returns true for all data that can be
rendererd. This must match the data for which getComponent() works with, or you
may confuse the users of this SPI. The getComponent() method can return any
JComponent you wish for displaying the data. In the future, we may add API for
registering menu items and so forth. At the moment, this JComponent should be
totaly self-contained.
</p>

<p>
The getName() method should always return the same string. The getIcon() method
can check the object and MIME type to return an apropreate image for the data
but can also return the same icon for all cases.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, package your renderer up in a .jar file. To this .jar, add a file at
<code>META-INF/services/org.embl.ebi.escience.scuflui.renderers.MimeTypeRendererSPI</code>
containing the full class-name of your SPI implementation. If you have
several different SPIs in your .jar file, then add each class name on its own
line. The registry will take care of loading all of the classes listed in this
file, and will be able to load in classes from multiple .jar files.
