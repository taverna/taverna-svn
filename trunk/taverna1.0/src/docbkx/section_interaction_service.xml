  <title>Taverna Interaction Service</title>

  <para>The Taverna Interaction Service plugin is a plugin for Taverna that
  introduces the concept of an Interaction Service Processor. An Interaction
  Service mediates between the automated workflow system and a user or
  users.</para>

  <para>To install the Interaction Service Processor use the Plugin Manager in
  the Tools Menu.</para>

  <para>The Interaction Service Processor depends upon the presence of
  Interaction Services already installed on the web. A default Interaction
  Service is available in the Taverna Utilities subsection under downloads on
  the Taverna sourceforge site.</para>

    <title>Using the Interaction Service from Taverna</title>

    <para>After installation, a new option "Add New Interaction Service" is
    available by right-clicking Available Processors in the service panel.
    Adding a new Interaction Service prompts for the URL where the Interaction
    Service has been installed. This will expose all <emphasis
    role="bold">interaction patterns</emphasis> described by the Interaction
    Service as processors to add to the workflow. The interaction pattern
    defines the input data for the interaction, the method by which the
    interaction takes place and the result data. The default Interaction
    Service has two patterns, a simple 'accept or reject' pattern and a more
    complex one based on a modified form of the Artemis sequence
    editor.</para>

    <para>The default patterns will, when invoked, send an email to the target
    user. This email consists of various HTTP links which the user selects to
    either reject the interaction or proceed. In the case of the trivial
    'accept / reject' pattern the data to be reviewed is sent in the email (so
    text only) and links below the data allow the user to accept or reject the
    data, the decision is sent back to the workflow engine and appears as the
    output of the interaction processor. The sequence review processor is
    significantly more complex; the link causes a modified version of Artemis
    to load on the user's desktop - the modification allows us to populate the
    sequence editor pane with the input data from the interaction processor.
    The user edits the annotation as per usual and commits it back along with
    a textual comment describing the changes and, as before, the workflow
    continues.</para>
