  <title>Useful properties.</title>

  <para>These are sytem properties that can be overridden in the startup
  script used to run Taverna or an external tool, such as
  exectuteworkflow.bat. The are overridden by appending
  -Dproperty=&lt;value&gt; to the list of arguments passed to the java
  command. The best way of overriding these is by adding to the existing set
  of ARGS already present in the current scripts.</para>

  <caution>
    <para>Changing these properties without having a clear idea what they mean
    can lead to unpredictable and sometimes irreversible behaviour. If you
    don't know what they mean, then you probably don't need to be changing
    them!</para>

          <entry>taverna.home</entry>

          <entry>String, e.g. C:/taverna-home/</entry>

          <entry>The location that Taverna settings, logging and libraries are
          stored. By defaut when using Windows this is "Documents and
          Settings\Application Data\Taverna", using Linux "$HOME/.taverna",
          and using the Mac "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Taverna".
          General configuration files are stored in $taverna.home/conf ; log
          files are stored in $taverna.home/log; details about installed
          plugins and plugin sites are stored in $taverna.home/plugins</entry>

        <row>
          <entry>taverna.repository</entry>

          <entry>String, e.g C:/taverna-cache/</entry>

          <entry>The location that local copies of the artifacts that Taverna
          is dependant upon are copied to. Note that only libraries that exist
          in a remote repository are copied here, if they have been found in a
          'file:/' based repository a local copy is not made. By default this
          is $taverna.home/repository.</entry>

        <row>
          <entry>raven.eclipse</entry>

          <entry>Any value</entry>

          <entry>An experimental setting that forces Taverna to use the System
          classloader rather than find classes via Raven. Its only useful when
          running Taverna within Eclipse - and even then the behaviour is not
          necessarily the same as running Taverna correctly. Its main use is
          for debugging.</entry>

        <row>
          <entry>raven.properties</entry>

          <entry>URL, e.g. file:... http://...</entry>

          <entry>The location of a file containing a list of the properties
          described here.Default value is
          http://www.mygrid.org.uk/taverna/updates/1.5/raven.properties</entry>
        </row>

        <row>
          <entry>raven.remoteprofile</entry>

          <entry>URL</entry>

          <entry>The remote location of the profile used. This is an xml
          document that describes the artifacts and their versions that are
          used by the Taverna core. This profile is not used until the user
          selects to do an update through the Taverna GUI, which is only
          available if the version of the profile is greater than the current
          running version of Taverna.</entry>
        </row>

        <row>
          <entry>raven.repository.n (where n is a number between 0 and
          10).</entry>

          <entry>URL</entry>

          <entry>These are repositories that are used to find artifacts, in
          numerical order. This is useful for intergraters or developers to
          them to enforce a particular location for an artifact rather than
          relying on myGrid or Maven repositories. The value 0 to 10,
          inclusively, are available for custom repositories. Its unsafe to
          use values higher than this. The common use of this is during
          development, to set the raven.repository.0 to the local maven
          repository - this ensures that locally built versions of the
          artifacts are used rather than those held remotely.</entry>
