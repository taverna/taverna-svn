<h1>Example workflows</h1>

<p>These are just a handful of the possible workflows you can build
using <a href="http://taverna.sourceforge.net/">Taverna</a>. To open a
workflow from inside Taverna, use <strong>File</strong> -> <strong>Open
workflow..</strong> and navigate to this directory.</p>

<p>Note that since most of these workflows depend on external web
services provided by third parties, and occasionally some of these
services might change or be unavailable, you might experience problems
executing a few of the workflows. Sign up for the <a
	href="http://taverna.sourceforge.net/lists">taverna-users mailing
list</a> to check for any updates on service disruptions.</p>

<p>You can find many more Taverna workflows contributed by users on
the website <a href="http://www.myexperiment.org/">myExperiment.org</a>
- in particular you should be able to find an updated list of these
examples in the pack <a
	href="http://www.myexperiment.org/packs/14"">Taverna 1.7.1 starter pack</a>. You can also see the list
of workflows <a href="http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/555">tagged
as <em>example</em></a> by other users.</p>

<p>For more information about how to build your own workflows, see
the <a href="http://www.mygrid.org.uk/usermanual1.7/">Taverna user
manual</a>.</p>
