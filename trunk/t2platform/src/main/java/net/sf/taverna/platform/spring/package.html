Extensions for Spring to allow it to access beans through Raven. When
this extension is present and used through the
RavenAwareClassPathXmlApplicationContext you can add artifact
information to any bean definition in the spring application context.
Provided you also define a reference to a raven repository through an
instance of the RepositoryFactoryBean Spring will automatically handle
the download of code to your specified repository cache and the various
classloader management aspects involved.
