/**
 * Allows multiple outputs to be routed to a single input within the dataflow.
 * The merge operation defines a total order over its input ports, this order is
 * used to modify the index array of all incoming events by adding the port
 * index as a prefix to that array. At a conceptual level this means that any
 * event coming in is 'binned' by port index creating a collection of whatever
 * the port type was. This also places a constraint that all input ports must
 * have the same cardinality (i.e. depth + length of index array must be equal
 * for all events on all ports). If this constraint is violated the merge
 * operation is free to throw a WorkflowStructureException at runtime although
 * it would be preferable if implementing classes were capable of static type
 * analysis to preclude this from happening.
