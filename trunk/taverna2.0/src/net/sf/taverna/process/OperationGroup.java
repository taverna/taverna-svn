 * The OperationGroup class represents an ordered list of Operation objects
 * and allows the extraction of a dynamically resolved view over this list
 * in the form of a list of tree models where the leaf nodes contain concrete
 * operations.<p>
 * The OperationGroup contains an ordered list of OperationFilter objects and
 * a single JobDispatcher object. The JobDispatcher is responsible for taking
 * the filtered list of Operation objects after resolution and applying individual
 * combinations of input data items from the job queue to them, it may do so in
 * serial or parallel forms and may or may not interact with the invoker to handle
 * rescheduling of failed jobs.<p>
 * The JobInvoker is responsible for actually calling the Operation concerned, it
 * may handle aspects such as recursive behaviours and fault tolerance at a per-job
 * level rather than per-process; as such it may request a reschedule of any single
 * job.
