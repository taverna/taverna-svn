            workflow to the server for later execution. Return the URL for the
            created workflow resource that can be used with submitJob()
            
        uploadData()-- Given a dictionary of input values to a

        submitJob() -- Given the URL for a workflow resource and optionally
            the URL for a input data resource, submit the a to the server 
            to be executed. Return the URL to the created job resource.
        
        getJobStatus() -- Get the status of the job. Return one of the values from
            Status.
