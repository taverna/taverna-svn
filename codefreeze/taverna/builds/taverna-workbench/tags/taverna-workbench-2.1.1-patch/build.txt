Build instructions
==================

See http://www.taverna.org.uk/developers/source-code/ for updated details.

You'll need these to compile:

Sun Java JDK 1.5 or newer (1.6 recommended)
 * http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads

Maven 2.0.10 or newer (2.2.1 recommended)
 * http://maven.apache.org/

Graphviz  (for diagram generation in the compiled product)
 * http://www.graphviz.org/



Compiling
---------

Run:

  export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx128m    (or equivalent for your shell/OS)
  mvn clean install -Prelease 

At first time run this will download various external dependencies from public
Maven repositories. Note that these dependencies are available under various
free licences such as the Apache licence and LGPL. 

    For Taverna 1 support some dependencies from Taverna 1 are also downloaded
    from the myGrid repositories. The source code for these can be found at
    http://launchpad.net/taverna/t1/1.7.2/+download/taverna-workbench-1.7.2-src.zip


When the build is complete, go to
products/net.sf.taverna.t2.taverna-workbench/workbench-distro/target where you
should find taverna-workbench-2.1.0.zip - unzip and run Taverna from there.


Subversion
----------
Note that in Subversion all modules have separate trunk/branches/tags structures
to facilitate individual release cycles. 

This virtual build tree uses svn:external properties to link say 
engine/net.sf.taverna.t2.core from /taverna/engine/net.sf.taverna.t2.core/trunk 
or equivalent tag.  You will need Subversion 1.5 or newer for this functionality.
