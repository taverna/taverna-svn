/**
 * A superclass for all iteration strategy nodes which are required to propagate
 * final completion events formed from multiple inputs. This is all the 'real'
 * iteration strategy nodes (but not the internal ones within the iteration
 * strategy object itself or the named input port nodes). All events are passed
 * to delegates in subclasses after which the completion state is checked, the
 * logic is as follows :
 * <p>
 * If the event received is final, that is to say it has an index of zero, and
 * final events have been received on all other inputs and at least one final
 * completion has been received then emit a final completion, otherwise do
 * nothing.
 * <p>
 * This means that subclasses should not emit final completion events themselves
 * - these will be handled by this superclass and emiting them in the subclass
 * will lead to duplicatation.
