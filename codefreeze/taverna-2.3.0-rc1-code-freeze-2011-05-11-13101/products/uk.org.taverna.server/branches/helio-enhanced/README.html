<h2><a name="about" />About</h2>
<p>This beta release is a feature-incomplete version of the Taverna
2 Server that has been made available to allow people outside the core
Taverna team the opportunity to provide input on their requirements from
a basis of trying to integrate things into their own deployments.</p>
<p>This release supports a number of key features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><b>Upload and Execution of arbitrary Taverna 2 workflows</b></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><b>Access to Workflow's Interim Output Files</b>; no need to
	wait for the workflow to finish if the results are available sooner</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p><b>Safe File Management</b> for handling results; workflows
		cannot interfere with each others files</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Simple mechanism for <b>Removal of Expired Workflows</b></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Support for both <b>RESTful and SOAP APIs</b>, for easier
	tooling</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><b>JMX-based Management API</b></p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of known-missing features; notably these
include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Security and User Management</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Provenance Database Access</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Workflow Event Listeners</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Persistence across Service Restarts</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="install" />Installation</h2>
<h3><a name="install/needed" />Prerequisites</h3>
<p>You will need a <b>Java 6</b> installation.</p>
<p>You will need a suitable <b>servlet container</b>.</p>
<dl>
	<dd>This software was developed using <a
		href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi"><b>Tomcat
	6.0.26</b></a> as the servlet container, but other versions of Tomcat are known
	to work (back to at least 6.0.20) and other containers may also
	function correctly as no Tomcat-specific APIs are used in the
	deployable code. We welcome feedback on which containers work, as well
	as on how to configure them (if they are not Tomcat versions).</dd>
</dl>
<p>You will need <a
	href="http://www.taverna.org.uk/download/taverna-2-2/"><b>Taverna
2.2</b></a> (or later) installed.</p>
<h3><a name="install/tomcat" />Installation into Tomcat</h3>
<p>Note that these instructions are Tomcat-specific.</p>
<h4>Step 1. Configure Tomcat for JMX</h4>
<p>If you're going to use JMX to administer the server (good for
demos; <tt>jvisualvm</tt> is recommended if you've got the JMX support
plugin, and <tt>jconsole</tt> is acceptable) then you need to edit
Tomcat's <tt>&lt;TOMCATDIR&gt;/bin/startup.sh</tt> script to include the
setting:</p>
<blockquote><pre>export CATALINA_OPTS=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This works around a minor bug in Spring which prevents correct
registration of management beans in the default internal management
service. You should also add additional options there to ensure that the
JMX management layer is secure; see the <a
	href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html"
	title="Monitoring and Management Using JMX Technology">Java JMX
documentation</a> for a discussion of how to do this.</p>
<p>Users on Windows should edit <tt>&lt;TOMCATDIR&gt;/bin/startup.bat</tt>
instead, adding the line:</p>
<blockquote><pre>set CATALINA_OPTS=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote</pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>Step 2. Configure Tomcat for General Management</h4>
<p>Add a user entry in <tt>&lt;TOMCATDIR&gt;/conf/tomcat-users.xml</tt>
so that the manager webapp can know who you are and that you have
permission to deploy webapps (i.e., the "<tt>manager</tt>" role).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to configure Tomcat to support HTTPS (recommended!)
then this is the point to do it. Follow the instructions <a
	href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/ssl-howto.html">on
the Tomcat site</a>. Note that this <i>only enables private
communication</i> with the Taverna Server, it does not enforce it and it
does not guarantee that access controls will be enforced. These issues
will be addressed in future releases of Taverna Server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now start Tomcat (or restart it).</p>
<h4>Step 3. Prepare for T2Server WebApp Installation</h4>
<p>Save the text below as <tt>context.xml</tt> on the machine where
you are going to install the server, updating the bold part to say where
your Taverna's <tt>executeworkflow.sh</tt> script is located. This is
currently the <em>only</em> required configuration step.</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;Context path="/taverna-server"&gt;
    &lt;Parameter name="executeWorkflowScript" override="false"
           value="<b>/usr/local/taverna-2.2/executeworkflow.sh</b>"/&gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<h4>Step 4. Download the Webapp ARchive</h4>
<p>Make sure that the <tt>.war</tt> file is also saved to the
machine on which you will be installing the server.</p>
<h4>Step 5. Install the WebApp</h4>
<p>Navigate to <tt>http://&lt;SERVER:PORT&gt;/manager/html</tt> and
go to the Deploy box. Fill in with:</p>
<blockquote>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th><b>Field</b></th>
		<th><b>Value</b></th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Context Path (required):</td>
		<td><tt>/taverna-server</tt></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>XML Configuration file URL:</td>
		<td><tt>file:<b>/path/to/context.xml</b></tt></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>WAR or Directory URL:</td>
		<td><tt>file:<b>/path/to/TavernaServer.war</b></tt></td>
	</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>Press the Deploy button; after a few seconds, Tomcat should
respond with OK (at the top of the reloaded page) and you'll have the
taverna-server webapp installed at <tt>http://&lt;SERVER:PORT&gt;/taverna-server</tt>.</p>

<h2><a name="usage" />Using the T2 Server</h2>
<p>The Taverna 2 Server supports both REST and SOAP APIs; you may
use either API to access the service and any of the workflow runs hosted
by the service. The full service descriptions are available at <tt>http://<b>&lt;SERVER:PORT&gt;</b>/taverna-server/services</tt>
but to illustrate their use, here's a sample execution using the REST
API.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The client starts by creating a workflow run. This is done by
	POSTing a wrapped T2flow document to the service at the address <tt>http://<b>&lt;SERVER:PORT&gt;</b>/taverna-server/rest/runs</tt></p>
	<p>The wrapping of the submitted document is a single XML element,
	<code>workflow</code> in the namespace <code>http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/xml/server/</code>,
	and the workflow (as saved by the Taverna Workbench) is the child
	element of that.</p>
	<p>The result of the POST is an <tt>HTTP 201 Created</tt> that
	gives the location of the created run (in a <tt>Location</tt> header),
	hereby denoted the <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b></tt> (it includes a UUID
	which you will need to save in order to access the run again, though
	the list of known UUIDs can be found above). Note that the run is not
	yet actually doing anything.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Next, you need to set up the inputs to the workflow ports. This
	is done by either uploading a file that is to be read from, or by
	directly setting the value.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><i>Directly Setting the Value of an Input</i></dt>
		<dd>
		<p>To set the input port, <tt><b>FOO</b></tt>, to have the value <tt><b>BAR</b></tt>,
		you would PUT a message like this to the URI <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/input/input/<b>FOO</b></tt></p>
		<blockquote><pre>&lt;t2sr:runInput xmlns:t2sr="http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/xml/server/rest/"&gt;
    &lt;t2sr:value&gt;<b>BAR</b>&lt;/t2sr:value&gt;
&lt;/t2sr:runInput&gt;</pre></blockquote>
		</dd>

		<dt><i>Uploading a File for One Input</i></dt>
		<dd>
		<p>The values for an input port can also be set by means of
		creating a file on the server. Thus, if you were staging the value BAR
		to input port FOO by means of a file BOO.TXT then you would first POST
		this message to <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/wd</tt></p>
		<blockquote><pre>&lt;t2sr:upload xmlns:t2sr="http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/xml/server/rest/" t2sr:name="<b>BOO.TXT</b>"&gt;
    QkFS
&lt;/t2sr:upload&gt;</pre></blockquote>
		<p>Note that &#x201c;<tt>QkFS</tt>&#x201d; is the base64-encoded
		form of &#x201c;<tt>BAR</tt>&#x201d;, and that each workflow run has
		its own working directory into which the uploads are placed; you are
		never told the name of this working directory. Once you've created the
		file, you can then set it to be the input for the port by PUTting this
		message to <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/input/input/<b>FOO</b></tt></p>
		<blockquote><pre>&lt;t2sr:runInput xmlns:t2sr="http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/xml/server/rest/"&gt;
    &lt;t2sr:file&gt;<b>BOO.TXT</b>&lt;/t2sr:file&gt;
&lt;/t2sr:runInput&gt;</pre></blockquote>
		<p>Note the similarity of the final part of this process to the
		previous method for setting an input.</p>
		<p>You can also create a directory, e.g., IN, to hold the input
		files. This is done by POSTing a different message to <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/wd</tt></p>
		<blockquote><pre>&lt;t2sr:mkdir xmlns:t2sr="http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/xml/server/rest/" t2sr:name="<b>IN</b>" /&gt;</pre></blockquote>
		<p>With that, you can then create files in the IN subdirectory by
		sending the <tt>upload</tt> message to <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/wd/IN</tt>
		and you can use the file as an input by using a name such as <tt>IN/BOO.TXT</tt>.
		You can also create sub-subdirectories if required by sending the <tt>mkdir</tt>
		message to the natural URI of the parent directory, just as sending an
		<tt>upload</tt> message to that URI creates a file in that directory.</p>
		</dd>

		<dt><i>Uploading a Baclava File</i></dt>
		<dd>
		<p>The final way of setting up the inputs to a workflow is to
		upload (using the same method as above) a Baclava file (e.g., <tt><b>FOOBAR.BACLAVA</b></tt>)
		that describes the inputs. This is then set as the provider for <i>all</i>
		inputs by PUTting the name of the Baclava file (as plain text) to <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/input/baclava</tt></p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Now you can start the file running. This is done by using a PUT
	to set <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/status</tt> to the plain text value <tt>Operating</tt>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Now you need to poll, waiting for the workflow to finish. To
	discover the state of a run, you can (at any time) do a GET on <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/status</tt>;
	when the workflow has finished executing, this will return <tt>Finished</tt>
	instead of <tt>Operating</tt> (or <tt>Initialized</tt>, the starting
	state).</p>
	<p>There is a fourth state, <tt>Stopped</tt>, but it is not
	supported in this release.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Every workflow run has an expiry time, after which it will be
	destroyed and all resources (i.e., local files) associated with it
	cleaned up. By default in this release, this is 20 minutes after
	initial creation. To see when a particular run is scheduled to be
	disposed of, do a GET on <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/expiry</tt>; you
	may set the time when the run is disposed of by PUTting a new time to
	that same URI. Note that this includes not just the time when the
	workflow is executing, but also when the input files are being created
	beforehand and when the results are being downloaded afterwards; you
	are advised to make your clients regularly advance the expiry time
	while the run is in use.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The outputs from the workflow are files created in the <tt>out</tt>
	subdirectory of the run's working directory. The contents of the
	subdirectory can be read by doing a GET on <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/wd/out</tt>
	which will return an XML document describing the contents of the
	directory, with links to each of the files within it. Doing a GET on
	those links will retrieve the actual created files (as uninterpreted
	binary data).</p>
	<p>Thus, if a single output <tt><b>FOO.OUT</b></tt> was produced
	from the workflow, it would be written to the file that can be
	retrieved from <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/wd/out/<b>FOO.OUT</b></tt>
	and the result of the GET on <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/wd/out</tt>
	would look something like this:</p>
	<blockquote><pre>&lt;t2sr:directoryContents xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xmlns:t2s="http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/xml/server/"
        xmlns:t2sr="http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/xml/server/rest/"&gt;
    &lt;t2s:file xlink:href="<b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/wd/out/<b>FOO.OUT</b>"
            t2sr:name="<b>FOO.OUT</b>"&gt;out/<b>FOO.OUT</b>&lt;/t2s:file&gt;
&lt;/t2sr:directoryContents&gt;</pre></blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The standard output and standard error from the T2 Command Line
	Executor subprocess can be read via properties of the special I/O
	listener. To do that, do a GET on <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b>/listeners/io/properties/<b>stdout</b></tt>
	(or <tt>.../<b>stderr</b></tt>). Once the subprocess has finished
	executing, the I/O listener will provide a third property containing
	the exit code of the subprocess, called <tt>exitcode</tt>.</p>
	<p>Note that the supported set of listeners and properties will be
	subject to change in future versions of the server, and should not be
	relied upon.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Once you have finished, destroy the run by doing a DELETE on <tt><b>&lt;RUN_URI&gt;</b></tt>.
	Once you have done that, none of the resources associated with the run
	(including both input and output files) will exist any more. If the run
	is still executing, this will also cause it to be stopped.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>All operations described above have equivalents in the SOAP
service interface.</p>

<h2><a name="manage" />Managing the Server</h2>
<p>The server is designed to be managed via JMX. This allows the use
of tools such as <tt>jconsole</tt> or <tt>jvisualvm</tt> (with
appropriate plugin) to connect to the server so that they can view,
chart, and manipulate properties of the server. The exact list of
properties is liable to change, but is as follows in this release:</p>
