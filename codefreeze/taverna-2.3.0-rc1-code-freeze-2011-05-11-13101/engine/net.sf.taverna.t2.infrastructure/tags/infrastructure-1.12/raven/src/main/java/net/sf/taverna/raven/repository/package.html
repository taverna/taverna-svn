Contains classes and interfaces to represent Artifacts and the local repository
structure which contains them. The Repository interface manages the download,
analysis and classloader management of Artifacts, each Artifact object mapping to
a single Maven2 pom with group ID, artifact ID and version parameters.<p>
RepositoryListeners are used by the spi package to automatically track the existance
of implementations of user specified interfaces within the set of Artifact objects
in the Repository.
