<h1>API Consumer 1.1 User Manual</h1>
<p>The API Consumer Tool allows the selection of subsets of Java APIs which may then 
  be imported into Taverna Workbench and used as services in 
  workflows. This tool is intended for API developers rather 
  than end-users. It produces an XML API definition file which Taverna imports 
  - this is file that you distribute alongside your API to 'Taverna 
  enable' it.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The API Consumer Tool is a Java Doclet and uses Ant to launch; you must therefore 
  have Java and Ant installed and available on the path. The Tool has been 
  tested on Java 1.6; use other versions at your own risk.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Before running the API Consumer Tool you need to place source files of your API within 
  the 'target' directory and any supporting libraries (i.e. dependencies) required in the 'lib' directory. 
  This is particularly important - if your API includes methods which consume 
  or return a type that is not available to the API Consumer Tool, the definitions it 
  generates will be invalid. For example, if your API contains a method <strong>"void 
  foo(<em>MagicClass</em> bar)"</strong> and the <strong>MagicClass</strong> is 
  in some random package in a third party jar file that you have not included there is 
  no way for the Doclet to know the fully qualified classname of <strong>MagicClass</strong>. 
  As Taverna requires full classnames, this will result in an API that 
  cannot be invoked from workflows. You can normally trap these issues by watching 
  for the standard Javadoc warning messages in the console.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Once your source and any supporting files are present as described above, from the API Consumer Tool directory you 
  can either run the "runme.bat"/"runme.sh" script or call Ant directly 
  (just type 'ant' on the command line). The API Consumer Tool itself will be built from source and applied to the target 
  source files of your API. After some slight delay for this process (longer for very complex 
  APIs) you should see a screen such as the following:</p>
<p><img src="images/InitialWindow.png" width="642" height="354"></p>
<p>The tree on the left hand side of the window shows the available classes (including 
  inner classes where present) along with a search box - the right hand side currently 
  shows nothing. Selecting a class from the tree produces a display like the following, 
  this should be clearly similar to the information produced by the standard Javadoc 
  tool:</p>
<p><img src="images/SummaryDisplay.png" width="890" height="475"></p>
<p>In the case of large APIs the search box can be used to display a subset of 
  the complete class tree - enter a pattern to match and hit return in this text 
  box and the tree will be expanded to show all matching nodes. To return to the 
  view with all nodes expanded clear the text in this box and hit return.</p>
<h3>Adding methods to the API definition</h3>
<p>The next step is to select methods to add to the API definition - these methods 
  (static, instance or constructors) will appear as services within Taverna 
  Workbench's Service Panel when the definition file is imported.</p>
<h4>Using Graphical Interface</h4>
<p>Methods can be manually added by choosing the class, opening the <strong>"Methods"</strong> 
  tab and either selecting individual methods or using the <strong>"Select all"</strong> 
  and <strong>"Clear all"</strong> boxes:</p>

<h4>Using JavaDoc tags</h4>
<p>For APIs under your direct control there is an alternative based on JavaDoc 
  tags. By adding the tag "@taverna.consume" to either classes or individual methods 
  you can automatically have these methods selected in the API consumer when it 
  first scans the source files. In the case of the tag at a class or interface 
  level all constructors and methods will be selected.</p>
<h3>API Level metadata</h3>
<p>To aid use of your exported API you can select the <strong>"API Description"</strong> 
  tab and use it to provide a name and description for the entire API subset:</p>
<p><img src="images/Description.png" width="664" height="357"></p>
<h3>Saving the API definition file</h3>
<p>To save the API definition select the <strong>"File" -&gt; "<strong>Save 
  as XML</strong>"</strong>. This should bring up a standard save dialogue, choose a filename 
  and save. This is the file that is then imported into Taverna Workbench's Service Panel 
  by selecting <strong>"Import new services" -&gt; "API Consumer..."</strong>.</p>
